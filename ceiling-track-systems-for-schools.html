                    <h3>What spaces can accept ceiling tracks?</h3>
                    <p>Most school spaces with adequate structural support can accommodate ceiling tracks, including
                        classrooms, gymnasiums, therapy suites, special education rooms, and multi-purpose areas. Our
                        on-site assessment evaluates structural capacity and recommends the best configuration for your
                        facility.</p>

                    <h3>How long does installation take?</h3>
                    <p>Installation timelines vary based on project scope, but typical single-room installations can be
                        completed in 1-3 days. Larger multi-zone projects may take 1-2 weeks. We work around your
                        schedule and can stage installations during breaks, weekends, or off-hours to minimize
                        disruption to school activities.</p>

                    <h3>What maintenance is required?</h3>
                    <p>Ceiling track systems require minimal maintenance. We recommend routine inspections every 6-12
                        months to check track integrity, mounting points, and moving components. We provide a
                        comprehensive maintenance plan with your handover package and offer ongoing support services.

                    <h3>Are there safety training requirements for staff?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, proper staff training is essential for safe operation. We provide comprehensive training
                        modules covering system operation, emergency procedures, student transfer protocols, and
                        troubleshooting. Training can be customized for different staff roles (teachers, aides,
                        therapists, maintenance personnel).</p>

                    <h3>What is the weight capacity of ceiling track systems?</h3>
                    <p>Weight capacities vary by system configuration, typically ranging from 300-600 lbs for
                        educational applications. All systems include certified load ratings and are engineered with
                        substantial safety factors. We specify the appropriate system based on your specific needs
                        during the assessment phase.</p>

                    <h3>Can ceiling tracks be integrated with existing equipment?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, our systems integrate seamlessly with most hoists, patient transfer devices, mobility aids,
                        and rehabilitation equipment from leading manufacturers. We evaluate compatibility during the
                        design phase and ensure proper integration during installation.</p>
