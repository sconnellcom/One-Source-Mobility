One Source Mobility builds trust through real-world expertise in fixing others' mistakes and delivering seamless solutions. The call transcript between Alex (owner) and Stephen reveals customer-focused stories that highlight reliability, training value, and the pitfalls of inexperienced contractors—perfect for your marketing site.

## Key Customer Stories

These anecdotes showcase Alex's hands-on problem-solving, emphasizing why specialized experience prevents costly redo's.

- **Ceiling Track Failure Rescue**: Another vendor installed a bathroom ceiling track system that didn't work for the family. Alex was called in to train on sling use and protocols—rather than ripping it out. Family members (including kids) needed consistent transfer methods, turning an unused system into a daily essential.[1]
- **School Transfer Protocols**: A special needs student's classroom used risky two-person deadlifts without slings. Alex highlighted how proper ceiling tracks enable safe, uniform protocols across classrooms—reducing risks like hospital worker's comp scenarios.[1]
- **Hospital-Style Training Gaps**: Vendors often install lifts without teaching usage or sling training, leaving systems idle for a year. Alex steps in for evaluations, demos, and staff training, ensuring equipment gets used effectively.[1]
- **Site Visit Quick Fixes**: At a major bathroom expansion (finding buried plumbing under footers), Alex resolved family questions in 30 minutes—issues a prior two-hour team meeting missed. This sparked immediate changes, texted to the crew, and aligned the case manager.[1]

## Actionable Marketing Insights

Use these to humanize the site, contrasting One Source's expertise with common failures.

- **Highlight Training as a Differentiator**: Feature "We train what others skip" with the ceiling track story. Promote free inservices/demos (that lead to sales) via testimonials: "Called in to save a failed install—now it's used daily."[1]
- **Warn on Vendor Shortcuts**: Page section: "Don't let cheap installs cost more later." Tie to 25+ fix-up projects for one agency, where underbids led to failures—One Source gets called back (but now sets boundaries).[1]
- **Quick Wins for Leads**: Stress 1-day installs (platform lifts, stair lifts, modular ramps, ceiling tracks, door openers) from private clients. Use grab bar stories: Small jobs reveal bigger needs, driving upsells.[1]
- **Family/School Empathy**: Quotes like "Kids at school need safe hygiene— we add showers when homes can't." Builds emotional connection for parents, case managers, OTs.[1]
