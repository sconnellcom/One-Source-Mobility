00:00:00
 
Alex: Hello.
Stephen Connell: Good afternoon. How are you,
Alex: I'm good.
Stephen Connell: Alex?
Alex: That webinar went a little bit actually. I didn't realize it was a twohour webinar. Um but I think I I got the gist of it for the first half,
Stephen Connell: Oh,
Alex: so I just jumped out of it. Anyways, sorry about that. That was a little bit more uh I was like,
Stephen Connell: Kevin,
Alex: "Oh, no.
Stephen Connell: no
Alex: I did not." It's funny because it's this it's uh complex rehab wheelchair
Stephen Connell: worries.
Alex: evaluations and there's CE credits that I need but of course then it jumps into
Stephen Connell: Oh, yeah.
Alex: um you know the next portion of it which uh is always kind of intriguing like when you know you have like cus and then they drop off and then they go into their demonstration as a manufacturer and I'm like oh I actually would like to know that applicable item but I really just needed the
Stephen Connell: right?
Alex: CEOs. So, um, yeah. Anyways,
Stephen Connell: All right.
Alex: how are you doing?
 
 
00:05:00
 
Stephen Connell: I'm doing good.
Alex: That's
Stephen Connell: Yeah, I had a call right before this one as well.
Alex: good.
Stephen Connell: And honestly, I'd kind of forgotten about this. I had forgotten we moved this call up. And fortunately,
Alex: Yeah,
Stephen Connell: my calendar alerted me right after I got off the phone the other call.
Alex: very much. Um
Stephen Connell: So, I I haven't I haven't done as much review for this call as I I was planning
Alex: uh
Stephen Connell: cuz
Alex: actually quite frankly um I don't care cuz um I'm I'm swamp.
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: My GM quit on me Sunday night by the way like via
Stephen Connell: Oh, no. So, shoot.
Alex: Yeah. So effective the Friday before and so therefore I am picking up pieces of um of basically his his he did not have any interest of telling me where anything was.
Stephen Connell: Oh
Alex: So I got a letter at like 5:00 on Sunday uh
Stephen Connell: man.
Alex: evening that it was effective uh the 9th. I was like oh that's interesting you're not even going to give notice or also tell me where anything is.
 
 
00:05:57
 
Alex: So which is part of some of the issues that we have been having that he has been you know it basically you know pushing somebody to a point that um the position has to be what the position is but also being honest that whether you can handle that position and one of the things that we've
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: been having is that uh there's been a his best work is not good enough you know and um that's falling behind and so uh next Monday we had
Stephen Connell: That's tough.
Alex: a meeting to do a review that we had set up, you know, for six months of that. And um I was going to either have to demote him, you know, obviously that has to do with compensation and those things um which is demoralizing as you know. Um but also I was trying to push him to be like I can't handle this.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Instead it kind of got into a uh actually the conversation ended relatively well on Friday. Hey, Kate. But um we had to have a we had to have one of those conversations of uh you're not a peer, you're an employee.
 
 
00:07:00
 
Stephen Connell: Gotcha. And the response was to
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: quit.
Alex: Yeah. Yeah. As in as in we're not peers actually.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Um I sorry that you feel that way, but that's not the way this works.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: And uh so anyways, so I'm picking up the pieces. The one thing the notation that I had, sorry, I just needed somebody to talk to about that, I guess.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. No problem.
Alex: Um and uh yeah,
Stephen Connell: That's frustrating.
Alex: frustrating, but you know, um working out of your house for six fig.
Stephen Connell: Sometimes we're leaving.
Alex: Well, you know, he was a friend of mine that he's been with me for three
Stephen Connell: Oh no.
Alex: years,
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: worked out of his house, you know, for six figures. um essentially 8 to four, you know, you just can't you you you can't you know,
Stephen Connell: off. Yep.
Alex: our hours aren't that, but he's got two small kids and um that's understandable. But the reality is, I mean, even if you're not until 5, that's 6 weeks less than everybody else is working of work and
 
 
00:08:03
 
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: unlimited vacation time. And you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: he took a week Thanksgiving, two weeks at Christmas. You know, that's I'm okay because we're a task driven company. I don't care about hours. I care about tasks and uh if everything was I'd have no problem.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: But um when you're not when everything is dropped and the field there's no production and guys aren't actually working in a field that doesn't generate income I start to have an issue.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For sure.
Alex: So um so yes and a relief of that because now I don't actually have to deal with that nor do I have to you know pay unemployment either. So,
Stephen Connell: Right. Well,
Alex: and the other thing is I don't need I don't need a GM.
Stephen Connell: hopefully not.
Alex: So,
Stephen Connell: Do Do you know if he has another job lined
Alex: he does not Yeah,
Stephen Connell: up?
Alex: he's decided to just kind of stay home.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Um, as as far as I know.
 
 
00:08:55
 
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: Yeah. Um, yeah, he could he could do so. Uh but we've had uh many of notes in which you know um of repeatable conversations you know um kind of the same topics over and over
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: again simple follow-ups simple task driven things you know that um that
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: are not high level like call the client back send him an email make contact um prioritize guaranteed business over
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: potential business. Um, if you need help,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: you have to ask. Uh, all in, you know, we're all in this together. Um, what we do inside the world doesn't need to know, so we can get through this together. No pride, you know, that kind of stuff. And so, yeah, I mean, he could I had a I learned this lesson about 15 years ago, too. I hired a friend and it turned the same thing. And then I denied his unemployment and you know he also came to he also came to work
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: drunk and right so that's
 
 
00:10:03
 
Stephen Connell: Oh, that's that's not good.
Alex: kind of an interesting thing. Hey one topic.
Stephen Connell: I had a Yeah, go ahead.
Alex: Go ahead.
Stephen Connell: I was just I had a job interview for a guy and he showed up at like 8
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: 8 or 8:30 in the morning and he he totally seemed with it, but he just absolutely rire of marijuana.
Alex: Oh my god.
Stephen Connell: And and then during the job interview, he he showed me like his previous work.
Alex: Really?
Stephen Connell: He currently had a job at a glass blowing company. And so he was showing me all these bongs that he had made that were on a on a
Alex: What?
Stephen Connell: website. And I'm like,
Alex: Oh my gosh.
Stephen Connell: "All right." I'm like I'm like,
Alex: Wow.
Stephen Connell: "I don't think we're the right we're not quite the right fit." But but it was like after he left, I actually did the interview with my with one of my other employees like sat in on it and we were just talking.
Alex: Yeah.
 
 
00:10:57
 
Stephen Connell: It was just like we were mind-blown.
Alex: Yeah,
Stephen Connell: We're like, "Dude, it's like 8:30 in the morning like at like two two one like showing up showing up wreaking of marijuana to a job
Alex: that's insane. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: interview and then two at 8:30 in the morning."
Alex: and then showing the potential employer what you're like that's bizarre
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: behavior.
Stephen Connell: He was not he was not trying to hide it.
Alex: I mean I give him credit for sticking and just going this is who I am by the way.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: Um that's uh that's a
Stephen Connell: Evidently though pretty funny. So
Alex: good one. I don't think I've necessarily had that happen before.
Stephen Connell: yeah,
Alex: Um I've had some interesting ones. Um, but I think that's Yeah, I don't think I've had that one before. Jeez. That's pretty
Stephen Connell: and this was before this was before marijuana was legal in California.
Alex: fun.
Stephen Connell: It was it was a good it was like 2013
Alex: That's even better.
 
 
00:11:57
 
Stephen Connell: 2014.
Alex: Oh my gosh,
Stephen Connell: So it was like there's no there's no like gray
Alex: that's so funny.
Stephen Connell: area.
Alex: Oh boy, that's a good one. That's That's an interest.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: people are very interesting. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: Um it definitely um it definitely is disruptive for sure.
Stephen Connell: Oh yeah.
Alex: Um and I you know he's a very good person. Um like him a lot, you know, but uh it's still a business here, you know,
Stephen Connell: Yep. Yep.
Alex: and um sometime Yeah,
Stephen Connell: Sometimes it's nice when they make that hard choice for you, though.
Alex: it is. And sometimes it's just you know the the the separation of of um I can be difficult you know because between the hours of business it's a business you know if if you can have a separation from a personal thing when it's appropriate well then that's okay but if you can then
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: we can't really have this personal thing either because this is business and
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Right.
Alex: um you know I've often talked to people employees in the past too the same thing.
 
 
00:13:01
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: It's like if you can separate that, we can have a beer together. If we can't, we can't. That's just if that's I'm two different people.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: When I'm working, I'm working, you know, and it becomes the personal,
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: it's personal. That's fine. But there's not a there's not a separation there, you know, or I mean, you know, from them if it isn't. So, yeah,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: it sucks. I'm really But I got to find somebody else and I really got to find somebody that's more administration, you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: really not that role.
Stephen Connell: Who Who were you already looking for? Cuz you were already looking for a position. Was it that same
Alex: Yeah. Yes.
Stephen Connell: position?
Alex: I was trying to get some admin help kind of um for him too um and for both
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: of us. But uh now realistically, you know, and I kind of knew that kind of going in, but what do you do when you're kind of grooming somebody to do that?
 
 
00:13:50
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: And then again, a GM role is I should not have to be into day-to-day operations. you know, I should be able to work on the company and um,
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: you know, come to me when necessary, but it, you know, there should be, you know, ideas that come with that and there should be potential business opportunity, you know, all the things that go with that. And it it takes a lot of work. It definitely does. And I've been in that role before and it takes a lot of nights, weekends, being a buffer between everybody, um, taking a lot of crap that you don't want to. um there's just a lot of stuff that is uh is certainly
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: there and so but um yeah kind of unfortunate he's a good
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: guy really is a big it's a loss but like I said it um was a pretty
Stephen Connell: for sure.
Alex: substantial amount of what I would consider for our small company
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: financially and um it uh new beginning and then
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
 
 
00:14:51
 
Stephen Connell: New beginning.
Alex: I can kind of decrease some of that too. So the um the other thing about that is is just the reality of coming up with that revenue every month to pay those bills. You know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah. See how much of that you can replace with
Alex: uh you know,
Stephen Connell: AI.
Alex: 10,000 $10,000 a month is a
Stephen Connell: Your next guy, it's a lot.
Alex: lot.
Stephen Connell: Yep. You got to you got to hire someone that is good with AI and uses it to increase their communication efficiency because right now AI is like way
Alex: Right.
Stephen Connell: way more powerful as far as email communication goes. So if he's doing a lot of email communication,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: if that person if that
Alex: One of the issues that we continue to have is a simple thing.
Stephen Connell: position
Alex: So, when we go to a site visit, we need to have obviously followup with those families,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: you know, which includes flyers that I've created um that need to be emailed out,
 
 
00:15:47
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: which are project, you know, pictures, things like that. But like little things like that that were just like constant conversation about that, like did you No, I haven't done that.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Like, how have you not done that? We've talked about this more times than I want to talk about. What is the point of going out there to do something if you have zero followup with you know
Stephen Connell: Right. That's crucial. Yeah. Do you have a system in place to help
Alex: that's we just have an email that's generated you know you just keep
Stephen Connell: them?
Alex: forward it and you just attachment you know it's pretty re like I was talking about too simple things like I have an
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: like his iPad not set up like how do you not have and want like I I kind of push this like the pictures that I have for instance I was at a family's home yesterday and was able to course pull up pictures kind of work through this problem, you know, send them out, yada yada yada, work through this an hour and a half later, we're good to go.
 
 
00:16:41
 
Alex: You know, versus not being prepared for that and then having another task when you leave really cuts in your day when you can just take care of it there. Like,
Stephen Connell: Please.
Alex: how are you not interested of like knowing and and transferring the pictures that we have onto yours? And it's that intent to learn. I think I have an issue with like just being curious and thinking about it. I mean, you know, unfortunately, work kind of flows into our personal life and yes, you should be think, but there also should be enthusiasm. Like, I want to have this so I could be better. I'm like, you should walk out of a client's home or site visit that was a walkthrough. You should have that email already ready and just send it. You can send it right off your iPad and just move on to the next one.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: Why are we coming all the way home?
Stephen Connell: Yeah. I should be at the car. You should be at the
Alex: Yeah. And plus, there's a delay in between those site visits.
 
 
00:17:27
 
Stephen Connell: car.
Alex: So if you have three to four of those and and they only happen like twice a month, you know, this is maybe eight, you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: and so maybe you're doing it 10 times, let's say. I mean, that's just not a lot. It's just not a lot of um time. And so little things like that, communication with clients, you know, giving them enough lead time for stuff, um, communicating up to project management stuff, you know, um, finding with the project management, knowing where things are so that you can schedule the guys appropriately. Uh, I got to know when something's starting or and stopping so that you can schedule that. Um, where are we at on things? Having to know where those are. um you know if you don't know who are you asking uh what do we need that are going to you know what what's you know being our hurdles where's where's the you know roadblocks how can we knock those
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: down like if you know you're constantly overwhelmed well then where is that overwhelm is it is it because you're overwhelmed or is it the actual work you know
 
 
00:18:37
 
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: um is it you know where's the most you know brain activity like for me sitting being in front of a computer writing an email is the most brain activity I have. Like it really wipes me out. Like I hate it. Um, you know, so I just,
Stephen Connell: Have you have you used AI?
Alex: you know,
Stephen Connell: Do you use the AI for
Alex: so what I just started to do this week cuz I had left is that instead of generating emails,
Stephen Connell: that?
Alex: I just threw it into chat and I was like,
Stephen Connell: Yep. Okay. Yep.
Alex: write this professionally or Uhhuh.
Stephen Connell: say this is what I want to communicate and then let it and then read it and see if it matches what you want to say. It takes a lot of the mental overload off.
Alex: And I did that and then I just saved them like in like a example email type of thing for
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: that particular topic and I just saved them in there and I was like cool I can just reforward this.
 
 
00:19:22
 
Stephen Connell: perfect.
Alex: Um,
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: you know, we just had like, you know, understanding where the track, like all of our ceiling track system parts and all that kind of stuff like that, like where it's at, like misord orders, like small things. Like all of a sudden, I got an order right after we did inventory. And this order was placed. I'm like, we have three of these in stock. And it's like, well, that's a miss, you know, you know, an oversight. And I'm like, how do you how do you That was like 3 weeks ago. And plus, we have a we have a whole spreadsheet. Why aren't you checking the inventory before ordering stuff? And then I'm looking at all the and then there's a whole bunch of shipments that came in which I wanted to have so I could get it off the you know get the payouts before the end of the year but like we order a whole bunch of stuff that we don't need. I'm like ordering is one thing but inventory management is a whole different thing you
 
 
00:20:09
 
Stephen Connell: M.
Alex: know so it's not the money more of like what's you're not capable of doing
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: this and so when challenged with that you know people sometimes will either like rise up or they'll just fall out and um
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah. So, was this that same person that was with was that issue?
Alex: yeshm and I was hoping he'd rise up you know cuz I've
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: had those conversations of being an employee employee for a company, too. And I'm like, "Oh, boy. I got to get my s*** together. I'm about ready to lose my job." You know,
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: and uh I'm kind of annoying to people.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Like, I'm like, "Okay, what do I need to do better? How do I get your help? What do I need to do? Where is it the frustrations?
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: How do I take this out of this? Like, who is it out? If it's not you, who?" You know, like that kind. And I'm like, "Uh, you go if you go quiet and I don't hear anything,
 
 
00:20:59
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: something's wrong." So, yeah. But it sucks. So, um,
Stephen Connell: It does.
Alex: because he was doing some really good things and so at least he could go to appointments, gather data, do a service appointment, too, building permits, you know, some really good stuff. Design plans, putting things together. But again, that's not GM RO stuff.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: That's that's like admin stuff, you know? So,
Stephen Connell: Well, that going to the appointments,
Alex: I gota It
Stephen Connell: I think that's the hardest one probably cuz that person needs that person needs to be competent in
Alex: is.
Stephen Connell: a specific type of
Alex: Yep. Yes. Very much.
Stephen Connell: way.
Alex: And that um that's a big loss. And he was learning that a lot, you know. U although I did hear some stuff from the field guys that were like,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: "Hey, I've been concerned a little bit. I just there's a hierarchy that we were trying to follow and um you know, there was things missed." And then we asked like, "What do you want to do about this?" And you know,
 
 
00:22:07
 
Alex: we got this and then a few weeks later we got yelled at. And I was like, "Oh yeah, probably cuz I looked at pictures and said, "What the f*** are we? Why would we do it this way?" And they're like, "Cuz he said that this is the way we're going to do it." And they're like,
Stephen Connell: M.
Alex: "Okay." You know, and then they're like, "Yeah, that's kind of what we figured. You probably got the word." And like go tell these guys to redo this.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Oh,
Alex: which my expectation is is like you don't know like hey I want to confine in you just little like let's get a quick
Stephen Connell: man.
Alex: meeting what what do you think here you know until you
Stephen Connell: Like, do you want your your guys to go over the GM's head or not?
Alex: can no I expect the GM to
Stephen Connell: Really?
Alex: come to me for that if he doesn't know
Stephen Connell: Right. Okay. Yeah.
Alex: yeah
Stephen Connell: But you're It sounds like you're saying the guys kind of knew they were doing it wrong or not.
 
 
00:22:56
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: they were feeling they're like well that's interesting because we've never really done it that Okay.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: Um,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: is there Okay, sure. We'll do it that way.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: I'm like,
Stephen Connell: Oh
Alex: okay. So, I probably spent some money that I didn't need to and um but that's okay.
Stephen Connell: man.
Alex: He's like I said, he's a he's a great guy and um I wish it would have worked out and I laughed at us, too.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Like, if you want to do some stuff in the future, let me know. I mean, it's one of those things I always people cool down after a while. And of course, we talked on Monday and he was like, it's kind of funny. I'm going to vent to you a little bit, I guess,
Stephen Connell: Uh yeah,
Alex: because it uh he's he's like,
Stephen Connell: no problem.
Alex: "If I would have saw you this weekend, I'd tell you to f*** off." And I'm like, "Wait a second.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: We had a very good positive conversation on Friday.
 
 
00:23:46
 
Alex: What happened to that conversation?" He's like, "I just stewed on it after, you know, I'm like, then you're having a conversation that didn't exist." which was part of our conversation on Friday that we talked about that you're saying this happens and I'm asking you when has this conversation ever happened and then all of a sudden you're saying to me that it hasn't happened. And I'm like, "Okay, so now you're manifesting things that actually aren't there, you know, like,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: stop doing that. Stop doing that." Yeah,
Stephen Connell: Sounds like sounds like something might happen with my wife.
Alex: precisely. That's Yeah, exactly. We kind of used that.
Stephen Connell: You're like, "Hold
Alex: I'm like I'm like, "Okay,
Stephen Connell: on."
Alex: that's fine. We can, you know, no problems there, you know, but come on, man." And like it at what point in time has this not been a uh a free flowing
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: um you know conversation and he's like well sometimes you're sometimes you're not the easiest person to talk to. Well, I'm like why? Cuz I'm busy, you know.
 
 
00:24:42
 
Alex: Is it something in which you've interrupted me on? And I say, hey, can you you give me a moment for this? Uh let's meet at 10:00 a.m. And then I'm irritated that you have nothing planned. Yeah, I can get that. Sure.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Mhm. Definitely. Yep. Definitely.
Stephen Connell: Or or is it like a communication issue where he wants to say something
Alex: So, right.
Stephen Connell: and he just can't spit it out or doesn't know how to how to say
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: it?
Alex: I think it's a it's one of those things as as he talked to me, he's he's like sometimes, you know, you just you you talk to me a certain way and you know, you don't talk to me as a peer as a peer.
Stephen Connell: Right. Oh,
Alex: And he's using and I was like,
Stephen Connell: right. That's right. You mentioned that earlier.
Alex: yeah. And I'm like, we're not peers. And he's like,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: well, we're the same age. I'm like, that has zero to do with the employment.
 
 
00:25:29
 
Alex: Like what that with that,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: you know, what do you do when somebody's younger than you? Uh what do you do in a professional atmosphere when you know somebody's less experienced in those things? Like you don't I'm like boy, I'm losing my mind here. So it's fine.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I you know it sucks though in all all reality cuz
Stephen Connell: I had a I had an employee that had a lot of issues with like disrespect.
Alex: pick.
Stephen Connell: Like he he thought he thought I was disrespecting him.
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: I'm like, I'm not I'm not disrespecting you.
Alex: Yes.
Stephen Connell: I'm like, you know,
Alex: That's how he
Stephen Connell: and it it was like there's a lot a lot of emotion tied up in there.
Alex: felt.
Stephen Connell: That was tough. and and it's been it's been a long time,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: but it it's this is reminding me of that where like he Yeah. He uh you get real upset and like the same kind of thing like conversations we didn't have.
 
 
00:26:21
 
Stephen Connell: But I think in this in his case it was I remember that the line I kept I kept saying to him was like don't like don't take offense to where no offense is intended you know like he would he would get super offended by something that
Alex: Yes. Mhm.
Stephen Connell: wasn't even said or like you know where it's like let's if if
Alex: Yes.
Stephen Connell: you think I think something and then I and then and then we talk about it and it's not what I'm even trying to say to
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: you That's where you need to stop being offended.
Alex: Yes. Mhm.
Stephen Connell: you know, they're like, "Oh,
Alex: And there also certainly like if the offensives too is is that there's a an issue with work or something like that and you're taking offense to it then I'm like why are you taking offense to something like that that that you know that doesn't necessarily I I don't
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: understand where that's kind of coming from because then then we're arguing you're just trying to argue a point which could leads to concerns for me because you're arguing a point that doesn't exist either and this you're you're
 
 
00:27:23
 
Stephen Connell: Right,
Alex: trying to justify something which is more concerning to me because of that.
Stephen Connell: right,
Alex: You can just say I screwed up and like I don't care.
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: You know, I've never, you know, we are a celebratory,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: you know, culture of of that. And uh I'm the one paying the bills. So if I'm not worried about it, don't worry about it. So,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: if you're really trying to have an argument with this thing,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I'm really concerned with that because that's,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: you know, and that's what I he had a disrespectful um aspect of that. And I as I told him, I was like, this owner of the company, I have every right to ask you where things are at.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: As simple as that, buddy. like at any point in time.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And I don't do that, by the way, because one of the things are is I generally leave people alone. And I've left them alone for about four months until we got to this point where it's like we had zero
 
 
00:28:19
 
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: work for one of the guys.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: He hasn't had work in six weeks.
Stephen Connell: Oh man. Yeah.
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: And see the problem there is that he wants you to leave him alone because he doesn't want to get called out on his shortcoming which he knows he has.
Alex: Yeah. Right.
Stephen Connell: So there's this the knee-jerk reaction is is based on his own
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: self-criticism probably. So he's probably like a lot of times people will criticize themselves and uh
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: and then they'll they'll project that on to others. So,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: and and that's actually exactly what what usually happens, you know, when it's like with my employee, too, like he's projecting that that disrespect and where it's like, dude, I didn't I'm not saying that, you know, like like you said,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: I just want to know like where are we on this project? Like if if asking where are we on this project when you haven't asked in four months is disrespectful.
 
 
00:29:17
 
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: Nah,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: that means that means that he knows he he's not where he should be, you know,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: and he's already been beating himself up about
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: it.
Alex: Yeah. And then the energy is out, you know, cuz it's it's like the internalization of that kind of stuff and then you're like exhausted on top of actually being exhausted
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: from work and then that is it's all of that and then you're then you got
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: you got nothing. You're just like holding on and um that sucks cuz I don't want
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: anybody to be in that situation.
Stephen Connell: No,
Alex: But I do have a tendency to like if you have a and I told him this and I've told everybody like if
Stephen Connell: totally.
Alex: you have a goal and you say hey this is the goal I want to get to in life I'm 100% in like let's do this and uh I'll work next to you I'll do whatever we need to do to get to obviously there's
 
 
00:30:08
 
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: finances that need to go into that because it just doesn't come out of thin air you know and all that kind of stuff
Stephen Connell: Right. Yep.
Alex: but if you own that goal and that's your goal I'm there let's do this you know Um, but if all of a sudden that goal becomes too much and you don't come back to me and
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: say, "I need to reconsider this. Um,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: I don't think this is my goal anymore. I can't be married to this." And um, and if you're not coming to me and say, "Hey, I got to I got to restructure this thing." I'm going to keep pushing you because you told me where you want to be.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Let's do it.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: You know, you know, you want to be a starting team player.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Let's do this. you know, um,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: but you can't be irritated when I'm pushing you. And, uh, cuz you're the one,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: you know, it's like he came with a big plan in August that he wanted to get to and it was all written out.
 
 
00:31:07
 
Alex: I'm like, "Okay, let's do it." I, you know, let's reevaluate this at the end of uh, January and, uh, you know, it's just one of those things and you're like, "Huh?" But, you know, great teams are made up of, you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: the ability to have conflict and look past that for the goal that everybody's trying to accomplish. And that's generally a company goal. And if the if the internal conflicts can't get past those things because we're not all fighting for this
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: the common goal here, then it just doesn't work.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. No, that's for sure.
Alex: And uh it's that I hate to say it but most of it is you know it it's mostly revenue based you know because people it's generally about um
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: of course uh money money and and uh professional you know positions and things like that.
Stephen Connell: Yes.
Alex: So yeah it's kind of interesting. Um,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: but I need to kind of restructure and uh look at some different things about actually what I need to cuz I really don't need that and I need to we're not going to grow that big anymore.
 
 
00:32:14
 
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: I don't have any interest of doing that. So,
Stephen Connell: Oh,
Alex: you know,
Stephen Connell: gotcha. Yeah,
Alex: you
Stephen Connell: that's one one thing that my old partner used to always say is like every time every time he'd
Alex: know
Stephen Connell: hire,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: he would do a better job because he had a more clear idea of what it is he needed. And you know,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: and this was regarding his next business as well,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: not just it was after we're no longer partners, but you know,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: so you know, this is like an opportunity to look at what what do you need now? And you be able to fill that space better than you could
Alex: Right. Mhm.
Stephen Connell: before.
Alex: Well, like Uriah, we were a businessman. It was Jim, Uriah and I before I bought them out. Uh,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: both of them still work for me.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: As Uriah said, he's like, "Dude, we've been through some s***." And he's like,
 
 
00:33:05
 
Alex: "I've lost my Uriah." He's like,
Stephen Connell: Who was that?
Alex: "I have lost my s***." Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Uriah.
Alex: Cuz it was Jim,
Stephen Connell: Oh,
Alex: Uriah, and myself that owned the company previously.
Stephen Connell: gotcha. Yeah,
Alex: And And then when I bought them out,
Stephen Connell: I don't recall Uriah actually.
Alex: Yeah. he was part of he was the third partner, but he's like, "Yeah." He's like,
Stephen Connell: Gotcha.
Alex: "I've lost my, you know, lost it on you and this and that.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: we've been through these things and you know it's like then I calm down come back and be like you know it's the same thing kind of led to the the dissolving of the partnership or buyout and I'm like you know
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: it's like I quit and I'm like we're a corporation you just quit your job dude like you know you can't demand money you can't
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: do this kind of thing read read the actual uh corporation paperwork and you know and he's like well s***
Stephen Connell: Oh yeah.
Alex: can I have my job back.
 
 
00:33:58
 
Alex: I like, "Yeah, but not in this capacity. Let's work something out, you know, buy you out." Jim's like, "I'm done." You know,
Stephen Connell: That's funny.
Alex: I was like, "Yeah, you've been done for about a year at least." You know,
Stephen Connell: That's
Alex: it was it was actually a few years after he said he was going to leave.
Stephen Connell: funny.
Alex: And so I was like, "All right, let's just come up to a let's come up to a number. You know, here's your checks and uh you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: hey, we want to still work do work for that.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: Sounds great, guys. Sounds good. They're like, "Yeah,
Stephen Connell: That's funny.
Alex: and I don't have to listen to you as much." And I'm like, "Yep, that's true." Because as partners,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: I'm like, "We're either pushing his bulldozer together or we're not like
Stephen Connell: Oh, yep. Yep.
Alex: that's I'm not going to,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: you know, mediocre is not good enough for me to be partners with. That's just we can't do that stuff." And uh yeah,
 
 
00:34:44
 
Stephen Connell: Right. If you guys start pulling in different directions,
Alex: that doesn't work well.
Stephen Connell: it's trouble. Yep.
Alex: But yeah, but that's I mean that's the thing that uh we used to have too and I used to always say I'm like great teams I mean we can have conflict internally but we you know that's the the idea of having goals like we have to have a common goal that we're we're invested in like we emotionally feel that like we got to go you know whatever the stuff that we have whatever the hard conversations in which we have can't redirect us from the goal that we set that we needed to accomplish and that's to for the advancement of all of us financially employees, everybody, referral sources, everything.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: And then when it becomes like a personal thing and does that it's detrimental to the entirety of that which is of course is the entire you know incorporation in which we work for you know being
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: shareholders is one thing you know but we also have to keep in mind that we work for a company and uh even
 
 
00:35:43
 
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: though we own it you know technically you know you got to you got to own that and uh
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: so yeah it's kind of I don't know how to it's interesting sometimes I think I can be a lot to work with for sure. Um but um I also am like if we're going to do it, let's do it at 110%. Like or don't like let's sit home and not do anything.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: But I don't know. There's not another way for me. Like we're in or out,
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Oh, that's good. That is good.
Alex: you know?
Stephen Connell: Have that strong drive.
Alex: I mean, just I I don't know. It's uh I've taken many of those personality tests.
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: Um my I just took one again the other day because I tested I was going to give it to him again like to kind of
Stephen Connell: those are fun. Oh, yeah.
Alex: I was like we really got to figure out a different role and you know not offense but like let's let's find out where where you have kind of changed within this and you know let's use this to try to understand ourselves.
 
 
00:36:46
 
Alex: And I did it again. I'm like and I'm like um well I haven't changed much.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: I'm It's like, "All right, it turns out there's a consistency. I'm pretty sure I'm going to be this for the remainder of my
Stephen Connell: That's funny.
Alex: life.
Stephen Connell: That's really funny. I think the last time I did one of those was right before I fired someone.
Alex: Yeah, it's
Stephen Connell: It was like I did it for the whole team and it's like,
Alex: Uhhuh.
Stephen Connell: "Yep, nope. This isn't working out." Like,
Alex: No. Yep.
Stephen Connell: oh man.
Alex: Sometimes I'm like, okay. I was really looking for something different here that says I'm render wrong,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: and I don't and I'm like I just it's I I'm think that's
Stephen Connell: dude. Like I want to be wrong here, you
Alex: where that's an interesting thing you bring up,
Stephen Connell: know?
Alex: right? Because people think that like sometimes it's it's like we like this. I'm like first of all, I never enjoy firing somebody.
 
 
00:37:37
 
Stephen Connell: No.
Alex: I think it's everybody's a human being. Why would I ever have any sort of enjoyment in that?
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I don't care who you are.
Stephen Connell: I actually I actually I take the opposite stance on that. So I I love firing people and the reason why
Alex: Yeah, maybe I need to get
Stephen Connell: the reason why is because by the time I fire someone I have given them so many freaking
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: chances over so long that is like such a relief. You know it's been like eight months of like of like trying to find a place like trying to make this work for them. And and so like when when I when I finally like make that decision,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: it's like now we can move forward and there's like a direction.
Alex: Of
Stephen Connell: Whereas before that it's like you're in this in this if if if you're truly in a bad I'm only going to fire someone if we're in a really bad spot. And if we're truly in that bad spot,
 
 
00:38:26
 
Alex: course.
Stephen Connell: like getting it over with is like a relief for both of us. So, I don't know someone somebody that it was a co-orker I worked with.
Alex: Huh?
Stephen Connell: He was talking about a previous boss and he had like a specific shirt. They were in sale.
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: This guy was a sales guy and his boss previous boss was a sales. He had a specific shirt that he wore that was like his I'm going to fire someone today shirt. So, whenever they saw his boss show up with that shirt, they knew someone was going to get fired. And I can't remember what else he said,
Alex: Oh,
Stephen Connell: but it kind of changed the perspective for me of like of like I like like you said,
Alex: wow.
Stephen Connell: it's someone's life. That part is horrible.
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: Like,
Alex: Right. Right.
Stephen Connell: and and that's why that's why it's such a relief when I do fire someone because I've been giving them
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: such so many chances leading up to that that like it's, you know, like it's just a relief to have that new direction
 
 
00:39:20
 
Alex: you know, I need to do better with that.
Stephen Connell: and
Alex: One of the things that my wife Lindsay and I have talked about this for years is I'm and it's there is some childhood things. Uh so I don't see the bad in people and I don't see the
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: I don't feel abuse like that much. So like if she even from clients and things like that while it's happening I'm like a this sucks. But tomorrow it's like my body has just pushed it out and I I I can't I don't know it
Stephen Connell: Right. Yeah. You're like
Alex: anymore. And so with employees, the same thing happens.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And I go, you know, I'm like, that's why I have to take these notes.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And I'm like,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: okay, let's go back to this. Am I crazy? And you know, those kind of things. And then I still, no matter what it is,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: like you said, like my wife is like, three years we gave him, he can't even give us any notice.
 
 
00:40:15
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: like and apparently I paid him I paid him I paid him through the end of January too
Stephen Connell: that's that's crazy.
Alex: because I prepaid him just on salary and it was just how I give raises and it I just backdated it and just the way it worked out and I know his wife is in HR but the the issue happened is
Stephen Connell: Oh man.
Alex: my payroll person was like you've actually paid them through the end of January and I was like yeah but the the actual payub says through December and they're like yeah because the payroll we couldn't backed it, but if you look at and so she printed out this report and I was like, oh yeah, I gave him 13 checks last year. Okay. And I'm like, that's okay. Run a payroll through the 9th,
Stephen Connell: Wow.
Alex: right? And um I explained to him, I was like, hey, sorry, but here's a bonus. Appreciate your work. You know, that kind of thing. It's about thanks. But the reality is that check hasn't been cashed, which I know why because his wife is looking into that in a certain way.
 
 
00:41:10
 
Alex: And I'm like, okay, you know, this is kind of an interesting thing,
Stephen Connell: Uh yeah,
Alex: you know,
Stephen Connell: cuz after they cash the check,
Alex: but that's
Stephen Connell: that that means something, huh?
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: Oh, man.
Alex: So, it's like one of those kind of wacky kind of circumstances. I'm like, and my wife is like,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: are you serious? Like, we're friends. Well, we're not, you know, necessarily maybe anymore, but also like what a weird like why are and she's like you gave him
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: unlimited time. Anytime his kids were sick, you're like go take care of your kids. His wife wanted to do a date. Like they would take a whole afternoon to do a date like during the day like I was
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: I I would love to do that with my wife, you know. Um, but sometimes I was like I didn't say anything,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: but I will say that like in my back I'm like who takes a whole afternoon off on in the in during the week to be like we need to we need to go to lunch together and have some drinks and we're going to take the
 
 
00:42:07
 
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: whole we're going to have a whole thing, you know, and we got to do this kind of regularly. I'm like, that's it. All right, good for you, I guess. Um,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: except for I pay you for that,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: so you don't.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And then the time portion again is just like and then you know you have a company credit card anything you need don't worry about it just go buy it do whatever you you know she's like a lot of
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: autonomy to do whatever and that's this respect that you get back. I'm like she's she's a little more like I don't have that's a very
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: childish thing. Um, and that's not what you do and it's not how you quit and it's not how you wanted to be treated as a professional yet you just acted
Stephen Connell: That's the frustrating Yeah,
Alex: as a right.
Stephen Connell: that's the frustrating thing. Yep.
Alex: She's like I don't understand that.
Stephen Connell: I've seen that same kind of thing where it's like it wasn't at that level.
 
 
00:42:57
 
Alex: Uhhuh.
Stephen Connell: Uh,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: but like I've I haven't had an employee at that level before. Um,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: where they have like their own credit card and stuff. I mean, they have access to my credit card,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: but but anyway,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: there Yeah, it's just crazy that he wouldn't give you notice. That's that's a lot of there's a lot of emotions wrapped up in that.
Alex: He actually took all of his stuff, put it in storage and wrote me the letter and then of course wrote me a document and all the things that he put in storage including presents like for instance like he his desk chair you know like or I gave him a bike rack you know like personal like
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: things like this he's like and So I talked to him. I'm like, "Hey man,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: I don't these are some things I don't I don't want. Like the bike rack I gave you as a gift as a friend. Like this tool I gave you as a this is you just did inventory.
 
 
00:43:53
 
Alex: This isn't an inventory thing." He's like, "I want nothing to do with one source mobility." I'm like, "Okay, whoa, buddy." You know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah, he's hurt,
Alex: like I'm like,
Stephen Connell: man. That's
Alex: "Uh, I you're free to have it,
Stephen Connell: crazy.
Alex: but I understand if this is something that's traumatic to you, then that's fine. I get it." You know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: that's that's okay. But no,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: from my perspective is these were gifts that were given that were not associated to the company whatsoever. This is his personal life, you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: stuff like that. And uh yeah, he was very hurt. And I was like, I don't. So, it's kind of an interesting thing.
Stephen Connell: that sucks.
Alex: But the other part of that is is that what really sucks about that and what escalates and this goes into us owning businesses and this is always the concern. And this is what we talked as a partner like you have to effectively kind of work through this because people when they do things like this are going to start to justify their actions that they were right instead of going s*** I just quit a job a six-f figureure job with total
 
 
00:44:45
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: autonomy um working out of my house um complete
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: expenses everything there I mean 401k plan I mean I matched him you know 4% in salary of had to and but you know like bonuses, profit sharing, all you know like and but people aren't going to do that.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Wow.
Alex: What they'll do is they'll start to talk to people of a f*** him and f*** them, you know,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: and take it personally and then all of a sudden it escalates and it's like I'm not going to cash that check or I'm going to file a lawsuit.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I'm going to file this and I'm going to do this and their friends are like,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: "Yeah, you do that." Or their wife is like, "Yeah, do that." Because who wants to come home to their wife or if you know they did and
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: go, I just quit a job.
Stephen Connell: I've been dropping the ball. Yeah.
Alex: I just quit my job that is now going to take a substantial amount of income out of our house.
 
 
00:45:39
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And um you know, I know that he talked to his wife and they're like,
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: "Oh, spend time with the girls and things of that." Well, fact of the matter is he was able to do that and work, you know, and um you know,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: and the reason that he came to work for me is because the last time that they did this is he got so depressed that as a friend,
Stephen Connell: Oh,
Alex: I was like, "Let me create something for you." And I had him
Stephen Connell: yeah. That
Alex: start work with that. And then,
Stephen Connell: sucks.
Alex: you know, we started to create more and more and more. But I was like, "Yeah." So, it's kind of a I don't know.
Stephen Connell: That really sucks.
Alex: So, it's all the things and I used to talk to your Ryan Jim about that.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I'm like, you have to be really cautious because four months later when they're at a barbecue and they're like, we didn't get paid for the overtime and that company sucks.
 
 
00:46:32
 
Alex: And then pretty soon they're at, you know,
Stephen Connell: M
Alex: pretty soon they're you're getting letters. It's never over until it's over and there's a time frame and it's sucks.
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: So, it's an interesting thing. But yeah, I know that's why he's not cashing a check, which is interesting cuz his wife will cash a check immediately when I give a
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: payroll immediately like within hours.
Stephen Connell: Ah yeah.
Alex: So, it's pretty pretty interesting, man. So, hey, the other thing I did on the on the website portion of that, uh,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: uh, veteran VA grants, which we do have currently, uh, we haven't talked about that component. That was the only thing that I kind of had to put on list and I don't know how to work that in,
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: but I did um, was thinking about that yesterday, the housing grants for disabled veterans, which is under the resources. I would say that's kind of the I don't know how to work that in, and I'm not entirely sure. It's just that somehow having it on the site somewhere, you know, for searchability.
 
 
00:47:39
 
Alex: That's my only kind of notation really today.
Stephen Connell: So, let's see where where is it? It's on your You have the resources page on your old site.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: I see the disabled American veterans
Alex: And it's Yes.
Stephen Connell: link.
Alex: So those are grants that we can work with. So, the housing grants for disabled veterans, home improvements and structural alter alterations grant, special adaptive housing grant, and special home adaptation, which we don't work with too much, but each one of those grants under housing
Stephen Connell: What? What? What were you reading just now?
Alex: grants for disabled veterans under the resource tab on our current site.
Stephen Connell: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Alex: So,
Stephen Connell: Hadn't gotten far enough down.
Alex: I'm not sure Yeah.
Stephen Connell: There we go.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Oh,
Alex: Right. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: okay.
Alex: You So, I don't know.
Stephen Connell: I was I was looking the first section still. So,
Alex: I'm not sure,
Stephen Connell: yeah. Um Yeah.
Alex: but give that some thought. I don't even know.
 
 
00:48:38
 
Alex: I got to give it more thought, too. But so, I was at um I was with uh some people yesterday actually and this kind of VA stuff came up and they were asking me because they wanted like, "Oh, can we get more involved in this? These are actual competitors. Like, do you know much about it?" And I was like, they came some advice and stuff and I was like, "Oh jeez, we're really not even working with those grants much anymore." Um, so because the the what they do is that so
Stephen Connell: M.
Alex: the VA has to use veteranowned businesses for purchasing essentially products for the most part.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: But what these grants do I am not be great if I
Stephen Connell: Are you a veteran? Okay.
Alex: was but um I was too opinionated for that one. Um um I almost did by the way. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I almost went into the Air Force at one point.
Stephen Connell: Oh,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: nice.
Alex: until the recruiter showed up at my door and told me how dumb it was to go to college.
 
 
00:49:43
 
Alex: And I was like, you know what, dude? I don't think this is right.
Stephen Connell: That's funny.
Alex: I don't think this is right for me. Of course, I was young.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I was dumb. And I had gone out the night before, so I wasn't in the best shape either. And I was really I wasn't merely super invested in it, but I was like, why are you at my door at my parents or my mom's house, you know? I'm like, what are you doing here?
Stephen Connell: trying to get you to sign
Alex: That's I was Yeah, that's exactly what he was trying to do.
Stephen Connell: up.
Alex: And and uh and again, I guess I'm not a I guess I wasn't a person that you could do that to back then either. And I was like, "No, dude.
Stephen Connell: That's funny.
Alex: I'm I'm good." And then um they used to have a buddy program and my buddy Luke went into that. Now he's retired. He did his 20ome years in it. And then yeah,
Stephen Connell: Wow.
Alex: he stuck it out.
 
 
00:50:29
 
Stephen Connell: Wow. Nice.
Alex: So good for him.
Stephen Connell: Did you Did you work at NorCal Mobility?
Alex: Yeah,
Stephen Connell: North Vans.
Alex: that's where I started.
Stephen Connell: Who did you work for there? Were you or what did you do
Alex: So,
Stephen Connell: there?
Alex: so I started as sales and then I became a GM.
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: Yeah. Well,
Stephen Connell: Nice.
Alex: Ken Garzinski,
Stephen Connell: Yep. Oh man, that guy was crazy.
Alex: he was crazy. I actually used him as an example as we were talking about this the other day because Ken was an HR nightmare.
Stephen Connell: Oh, I bet. Yeah, dude. I learned I learned some lessons.
Alex: He was awful.
Stephen Connell: I learned some lessons from talking with them with with an Ann Wilson.
Alex: Oh gosh. Oh yeah,
Stephen Connell: Like,
Alex: I love the end.
Stephen Connell: oh my gosh. Because like my business is 100% like 100% paid.
Alex: Yes.
Stephen Connell: Well, not not 100%. It's at the time it's it's almost all paid via credit card and if it's not a credit card it's
 
 
00:51:22
 
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: it's check and and at some point like I was talking to
Alex: Right.
Stephen Connell: Ann and like the whole like paying people under the table it like
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: I was like how is that even possible cuz like I mean I'm so obsessive with books and keeping everything above board and like reconciling everything.
Alex: Me too.
Stephen Connell: It's like I can't even I couldn't even understand like how that would even work.
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: And she said something about like like if you have basically if you have money coming in under the table and you have money going out
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: under the table, you know,
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: and she she mentioned some things about NorCal vans that kind of just lit that up in my mind. I was like, "Oh, well,
Alex: So you had to be really cautious like if somebody paid in cash like so for instance like you
Stephen Connell: good lord." Yeah.
Alex: know we ended up uh with Sacramento location Fresno and Berling game. So we did have cash you know clients I mean it didn't happen very often but let's say you needed a set of hand controls and say back then it was less than a thousand bucks you know and somebody paying cash and you're
 
 
00:52:20
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: like a cool I got to send this to Chico whatever. Well, Ken a lot of times would be traveling around. So any cash that that was ever given, Kathy one time was like, "Nobody can give Ken cash. It'll never make it to us." You know,
Stephen Connell: Right. Yep.
Alex: and uh you know, obviously that adds up to thousands of dollars,
Stephen Connell: Oh my goodness.
Alex: you know, as he kind of goes around. But uh oh my goodness,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: he was so we were two pole locks from New York and uh we battled. I mean, we we you know, we definitely had our screaming matches and I like I'm not a yeller in
Stephen Connell: Oh man.
Alex: business. Like, I don't do that. The only time that I've ever probably done that is like NorCal Mobility. And I don't even know yelling is a different I I would say yelling is probably not necessarily,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: but really like you can go f*** yourself.
Stephen Connell: Intense.
Alex: Here's here's your keys.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
 
 
00:53:18
 
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: Like I remember we were doing the Sacramento location and his brother had done the the modif basically the the tenant improvement and so some of the tiles were coming up. They were stuck to the the showroom and he would just get on this thing like like fine so John can fix them. Let's move on to something else. And then he would just dig in and dig in and you're like what is your issue today?
Stephen Connell: Oh yeah.
Alex: you know, and then make it really toxic for like the new employees. And John's just sitting there kind of taking it.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: And his his brother John, who is the absolute opposite of Ken, by the way. And he's Yeah, he's great. I love John.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Now, by the way, I just talked to Ken recently again. Like I I still am in communication. Our relationship's great now. Um but um John goes, "He's like a big dog. You just pet him and calms down." And I'm like, John, I'm not into petting right now, you know?
 
 
00:54:22
 
Stephen Connell: That is so
Alex: And so I remember like having a whole out blowout with him right there.
Stephen Connell: funny.
Alex: And you know, like, and I was like, "Here's your f****** keys. Here's things. I quit, you know, don't call me." And he was like following me to the parking lot. He's like, "Uh, you just need to understand I'm kind of doing this for a,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: you know, for everybody to, you know, kind of have a a show of what what, you know, they got to get the stuff in line and it's not for you." And I'm like, it's inapprop can you not understand the inappropriateness of this? Like like you're directing all this so I'm taking the abuse so you can prove a point which we know is not true really, you know, like like it was awful. But yeah, I worked there.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Oh my goodness. I worked there 2001 2002 I think it started. Then I left and then I
Stephen Connell: Oh my goodness. That's probably about when that's probably about when I when I started working there,
 
 
00:55:13
 
Alex: Was it really?
Stephen Connell: working with him.
Alex: Yeah, because when you did the first site for the NorCal uh Yeah,
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: that was even probably before NorCal.
Stephen Connell: he was one of my first clients.
Alex: No kidding.
Stephen Connell: Like I mean I did I started I started doing web development in like junior high and so I graduated from
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: high school in 2001 and uh and so NorCal Vans
Alex: Yeah,
Stephen Connell: NorCal Mobility was my one of my first clients when I was in college
Alex: that's funny.
Stephen Connell: like that. Yeah. One of my longest longest clients,
Alex: And then uh NorCal Vans came along eventually,
Stephen Connell: but man.
Alex: you know, as a separate entity. I went back.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: So Ken and I communicated and and frankly after I left the first time like he like I left and I was like here's all your stuff.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: Here's this. Here's you know like I never leave on bad terms. Like I help Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. You got to Yeah.
 
 
00:56:10
 
Alex: And I think that's part of the other thing, too. It's like I help things through the process. I help this like I'll give you the weeks to do so. Make sure my deliveries are done. Clients are taken care of. Here's all the information. This is where I'm at on stuff.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: Well, anyways, he started to go through everything and he goes to Steve asked this cuz Steve called one.
Stephen Connell: Oh,
Alex: He goes, he goes, he just started going through everything and realized how organized and how effective you were.
Stephen Connell: yeah.
Alex: And uh and Steve's like, "We've all been telling you that for years, you know." So eventually he calls back and he's like,
Stephen Connell: That is too funny.
Alex: "What do you think about management?" And I was like, "Ken, not interested." You know,
Stephen Connell: Oh my goodness.
Alex: like and um I would went outside the industry and
Stephen Connell: That is too funny.
Alex: um but uh yeah, and eventually I went back and then I worked there again until was it 2007 to 2012 when he sold the company and uh yeah, so then and we worked through it.
 
 
00:57:00
 
Stephen Connell: Wow.
Alex: I mean, and and to at the end of it and stuff, too, we had a pretty darn good relationship. Like, I mean, overall,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: he was pretty cheap. So, one of the things is is Ken always owed me a lot of money cuz part of my compensation was based off of the
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: performance, you know,
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: and uh and we beat those expectations and then he wouldn't pay
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: me. So, we had some So, those would be the struggles, not the day-to-day stuff. I'm like,
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: "Where's my money?" You know,
Stephen Connell: that's an important one,
Alex: and so yeah, well,
Stephen Connell: too.
Alex: the first time I quit, he also owed me like several thousand dollar, you know.
Stephen Connell: Oh,
Alex: I'm like,
Stephen Connell: man.
Alex: "You can keep it, you know. I bought you cheap. See you." You know,
Stephen Connell: That's
Alex: and uh I was a little more um uh forceful because the compensation
Stephen Connell: funny.
Alex: was quite great at that point in time.
 
 
00:57:55
 
Alex: I think it would be at one point like 100 grand.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: It was like a lot,
Stephen Connell: Oh my goodness.
Alex: you know. So then um uh then I went back.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: So I worked I worked very briefly as a a sales rep for this HR company and then I ended up going back to them for a sales management role again. I I had this kind of thing of leaving companies and going back to them as a promotion and I did it again, you know, with them. But again, I I left on really good terms to go back to NorCal. I think I gave them a month, you know,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: and then helped out my sales manager even to the point cuz year end in that in that world is like a big
Stephen Connell: Wow.
Alex: deal like December cuz it sets up the whole year,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: dude. 25% of business like of contracts like in that first part. So Larry,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: I was like, I get it. Like you got this on your hand like your your boss is going to be like you lost somebody during the most critical time, you know?
 
 
00:58:53
 
Alex: So like I was like tell you what,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: we just don't say anything for a couple weeks, you know? And then he's like, "Yeah." And I was like, "Yeah." And so like, you know, and then I knew the vice president of sales and things of that. So when they were looking for I called and you know, and I, you know, they were like, "Yeah, he's" and I also like still kept in contact with them too,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: as I did with Ken even after I left. I don't know. I'm weird like that. Like I'll be like, "Okay, this was defunct or we left or whatever the terms." I'm like, "Oh, I'm going to still keep it like how's things going?" You know, stop by.
Stephen Connell: That's cool.
Alex: like I stopped by
Stephen Connell: I'm so bad at that. I Oh,
Alex: still
Stephen Connell: man. I I do I do always leave on good terms. That is, I think, crucial,
Alex: yeah terrible at
Stephen Connell: but I'm not great at following up and and Yeah.
 
 
00:59:39
 
Alex: that like I which I mean I guess has led to
Stephen Connell: But
Alex: well even with Jim and I right so Jim and I used to work at Norcow part of ways
Stephen Connell: Mhm. Yeah.
Alex: I was going to do this separate business I had I had you you know, gotten to the point where Lindsay and I had saved enough for me to I it was always my point to be self-employed. And then Jim and I had been still communicating through the time period.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: And then he's like, "What do you think about being a partner?" Or first of all, it was like coming to work. And I was like,
Stephen Connell: Nice.
Alex: "Uh, I have no interest of working, you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: like Jim, you work for me. I don't want to work for you.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I'm not interested in that." And let you know,
Stephen Connell: Exact
Alex: so then it was like, "Well, we could compete against each other. we can kind of join forces, you know, and you know,
Stephen Connell: right.
 
 
01:00:27
 
Alex: and so that that's led to our partnership is what happened. That was just because Ste was talking to Jim all the time like, "How's it going, buddy?" You know, like, you know, just I don't know. I guess I I don't know. It's it's I think it's natural for me to do that. So,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: but I also think that naturally I'm doing it because in case there's opportunities,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: I think that's why I'm also doing that because you never know like my executive vice
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: presidents and stuff from corporate like we don't do much anymore but for years we still communicated because I'm like hey you never know where Chris is going to land you know. Um,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: he kind of took a different role though and he just went into a producing role and got out of uh, management and just his wife's an attorney and they live in LA and everything's paid for and he doesn't really need to do much. So, he kind of got out of that role. But was interesting is is that when he got out of, you know, the executive role, my communications did drop off slightly with him.
 
 
01:01:30
 
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: I will admit. So there must be some sort of thing where they're I see an opportunity with somebody and I'll keep
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: that.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: But if it's dissolved and they're really not doing anything kind of like an employee like if you're never doing anything I I lose interest in you.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: You're boring to me.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Like I'm like where are we going with this?
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I'm not you're not challenging you.
Stephen Connell: That's funny. Yeah.
Alex: And so um I even talked to Chris probably
Stephen Connell: Well, that's definitely something I need to work on.
Alex: like
Stephen Connell: I've I like this fall I've worked on like putting together like a sales call list of like old contacts
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: and like dude,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: I just need to reach out to these guys and and and just I mean even friends like this
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: guy like one of my groomsmen I he's a graphic artist which there's potential there for work but I also just care
 
 
01:02:15
 
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: about them.
Alex: Of course.
Stephen Connell: I started reaching out reaching out to different people and it's been great to like talk to different people,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: but I I I have a hard time keeping it up. I'll be honest,
Alex: It's exhausting. I will say it.
Stephen Connell: it is exhausting.
Alex: It it it takes like a lot out of me.
Stephen Connell: That's interesting. It's surprising to hear that it's exhausting for you as well,
Alex: Like I can it
Stephen Connell: cuz that means that you're you're doing it uh you're not doing it because it comes easy.
Alex: is you
Stephen Connell: You're doing it because it cuz you Yeah.
Alex: just have to Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Because you see the value in it. I see the value in it.
Alex: Like like yesterday by the time I got home
Stephen Connell: I need to make it a make it a habit.
Alex: like I was driving home from like Sacramento just to Roseville, not very far and I was like I could pull over and take it like I could I could fall asleep.
 
 
01:02:56
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Like I that's how I was tired because I was like I had talked incessantly
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: all day. I was with another vendor fixing their problem. I'd been called in by another program manager to also solve this and then doing you know like
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I you know you're just trying to keep relationships and show the value of yourself too which was good there you know too which the program manager is like you obviously the only people
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: that know actually how to do this you know um which is great because that is the point but all of that stuff like I think that my wife being a high school teacher like can come home and she'll just crash on the couch because she's just given everything.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And even after 23 years,
Stephen Connell: Exhausted.
Alex: like last night, I mean, every night this week, which is normal, but last night, too, she's in bed. It's 11:00 and she's redoing slides for today. And I mean, she doesn't have to.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: That's just who she is, which is why I married her.
 
 
01:04:02
 
Alex: Like, she's a doer.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: She She's She's not good with subpar, you know? She likes to be an A student and um that's in her program and and
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah. That's awesome.
Alex: uh she built she's an elective because she's an art teacher and so she had built a program so much
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: they actually had to hire another teacher which I was like that's f*****
Stephen Connell: Oh, nice.
Alex: up. She had too many people too much enrollment as an elective you know and she cuz she has to
Stephen Connell: Oh. Mhm.
Alex: recruit every year for people. So she's constantly recruiting students because if she doesn't have the students then she doesn't have a job.
Stephen Connell: Oh,
Alex: And I mean she's got tenure.
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: They'd have to find something. But so she did this consistently for so many years that they literally had to hire another teacher and there's now there's like and I was like well that's interesting.
Stephen Connell: That's
Alex: So they won't give you an extra section but they'll hire another teacher.
 
 
01:04:49
 
Stephen Connell: funny.
Alex: And she's like I guess that that's that that's how that happened.
Stephen Connell: Telling.
Alex: And I was like,
Stephen Connell: That's telling.
Alex: so um it's but I think that people even
Stephen Connell: Oh man.
Alex: when it comes naturally like we're having this conversation, it's taxing like it's exhausting to have to stop by,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: pick up a phone, do these things and and be cheerful at the same time because
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: you can't just like pick up the phone and be like,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: "Hey, how are you?
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: How have you been?" Like you got to bring something to it.
Stephen Connell: You're like, I'm having a terrible day. You got you can't be depressing.
Alex: Yeah, they're like, "Oh, God,
Stephen Connell: Oh my.
Alex: I hope he doesn't call anymore and God if we have to work together." So,
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: yeah, but it's it's actually like Nolan used like I would talk to him about that too and like you don't this doesn't come easy, but once the same thing like you and I have talked once you get on the phone or once you get that you're fine.
 
 
01:05:51
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Right.
Alex: It's that leadup and at some point in time you're like you gotta be like are you doing it or
Stephen Connell: Yep. Definitely.
Alex: not? Like it's like if I'm doing it, I'm doing it now. Let's do it.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Um if I'm not doing it,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I got to just take it off the the the opportunities I might do. It's not a might do. It's a yes or no. And um I think that's how I look at it.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: But I definitely is beneficial. Like there has to be I hate to say that there's like a value there, but it really is.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. There definitely
Alex: And and then the other thing I will say though,
Stephen Connell: is.
Alex: like I got on the phone as soon as this happened, I started calling all kinds of people. I'm like, "Tell me people do you know, you know,
Stephen Connell: Oh,
Alex: who's out there?" You know, what what do we have?
Stephen Connell: yeah.
 
 
01:06:32
 
Alex: Like who's the people you're running into? There's things. This is kind of what I think I'm looking for. Might change, but let me know, you know?
Stephen Connell: Yeah, that's Yeah, that's key.
Alex: And that brings me out of a slump,
Stephen Connell: I'm gonna I'm gonna write that down.
Alex: I think, too, because like I'll look at the workload and I just want to sit down and cry, you know?
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: And I'm like, I like to sit sit in this corner, cry a little bit,
Stephen Connell: Yes.
Alex: and then uh I don't know what to do. And then sometimes I'm like, you know what to do. Just do one thing.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: Get one thing off your plate.
Stephen Connell: Just do it right.
Alex: Call some people. start making some headways,
Stephen Connell: I know.
Alex: start building a pipeline, figure it, you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: and then it will get me out of a slump because by the Yeah. Like by the by waking up by Tuesday morning, I was so excited about the opportunities that my whole I was like, we're taking over the world again, you know?
 
 
01:07:30
 
Alex: Like I was just like,
Stephen Connell: Nice.
Alex: yep, let's do it. Is it going to be hard? Yes. Does it going to suck? f*** yeah. But let's do it, you know? Thank you much.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And uh but and then you know you get into this uh you're like you're exhausted but you're like I should be exhausted. That's okay,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: you know. And
Stephen Connell: So who so who do you know Alex that would need app development,
Alex: uh
Stephen Connell: web development, custom database driven like like business management through the
Alex: um good question.
Stephen Connell: computer.
Alex: Um I need to then actually kind of
Stephen Connell: That's like what I'm good at making making business tools and business automation.
Alex: probably most of my competitors now that I'm thinking about it, right? Um because all of us with small companies need that, including myself.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: So there needs to be some things that I need to figure out that I need too. And sometimes I don't know what those things are until somebody tells me what they could be
 
 
01:08:29
 
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: and then I'm like,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: "Oh, that could be handy. Let's try that." I think the same thing that goes with those people,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: too. Um, like I was with a couple of them yesterday and um, yeah, now that you've put that in my head, now it's more upfront for me to think about what you're asking me.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Well, yeah. Think think about that.
Alex: And
Stephen Connell: The the things that we we've talked about, you know,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: as far as business automation goes is like like what do you have good inventory tracking support? Does that integrate with, you know, the other things in your business? Like that was one thing I did for NorCal Mobility a lot is like we like like that data like I
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: built a lot of databases for and that was a long time ago. That was rough compared to what we can build now. Um but but help right
Alex: Our inventory is a Excel sheet.
Stephen Connell: and there's advantages to that but there's a lot of there's like a lot better
 
 
01:09:39
 
Alex: Well, and also if you if you if the quantity is two and you made it one,
Stephen Connell: options.
Alex: but you also said you made it three,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: now the inventory is off because and
Stephen Connell: Right. Yeah.
Alex: then there's no CRM system um for me.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: There's no like even our quotes um are rudimentary. It's on an Excel sheet. And so you have to go through this whole rigomearo to basically go through here to find out how to quote
Stephen Connell: Gotcha.
Alex: something. And then you got to come up with the verbiage.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: And I've always wanted like some sort of quoting tool that like if you click on ceiling track systems, it populates on another tab essentially the verbiage of what that is. So you're not having to re or copy from a ma,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: you know,
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: because essentially what we're doing is we're copying it from a master list to put it on that each time.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: sucks. So,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
 
 
01:10:35
 
Alex: um that I I have to figure out. I got to figure out a duplicatable process for that too. And the other thing is so that other people can quote. And then the other thing I can't dissolve dissolve is the wrong word. Um, I need to dissolve some of the information that's on there because people can't necessarily have that is I don't want people knowing like what our gross profit's going to be,
Stephen Connell: M right.
Alex: you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah, for
Alex: um things like that that are just like no one knew everything.
Stephen Connell: sure.
Alex: I was like I'm very transparent. I'm like this is what our gross is going to be this year. This is what it you know um this is what we should make on this project.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: There should be some reason but they don't need to necessarily know as much. So, that needs to um I gotta kind of figure something out. Our ordering process sucks. Um our day-to-day stuff is really rudimentary. It's it takes it's very taxing. Service quotes even, you know, like these last few nights I've been up late just trying to keep up with our service quotes that you know that are well behind.
 
 
01:11:46
 
Alex: And it's there's a master to it, but you're still copying it and it's still taking too many steps and those steps are just too exhausting. So,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: um I'm not sure what to do with that. Um those are a couple areas that I'm really struggling with that really kind of bog us down. Um, like I was thinking the other day, I was like, geez, if if somebody goes through a site visit and the pictures are there, the measurements are there. Like pretty much anybody in the world should come up would be able to generate that estimate within reason, you know,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: but for some basic things,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: there's no reason that it should be taking this long. And I make too much of it because I'm like, oo, I need to really dive down and work through this. Nobody else does. Like we shouldn't have a system like that in public.
Stephen Connell: Right. Right. Yeah. It should be easy and
Alex: And then Mhm.
Stephen Connell: repeatable.
Alex: Yeah. having some sort of duplicatable process is what I really need.
 
 
01:12:56
 
Alex: Like our inventory like our equipment and used inventory, rentals, tools, office, vehicle, you know, but basically it's just like an Excel sheet with quantities on it. I mean it's that's like it doesn't like you have to go into this to find out what parts. Now fortunately I've decreased and worked pretty diligently on decreasing our amount of inventory we have because we don't really need it anymore. So that's good.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: NorCal was a nightmare and Ken liked having everything and uh and he found value
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: and part of when he was selling the company was an issue with him because all of that stuff was old and of course the company purchasing had no value of that and and they're like
Stephen Connell: Oh, right. And he saw value in that old
Alex: yeah and they're like we're going to pull up dumpsters and throw it in and you know life work of you know all that he took offense
Stephen Connell: stuff.
Alex: to that and it's like we always tell him you're like we need to throw this out.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
 
 
01:13:52
 
Alex: The crazy thing would happen though, like you'd have these conversations and then he would find some buyer for this like high-tech driving control system that had been abs like obsolete for a while.
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: There's no warranty and quite frankly, we shouldn't be putting it in. And he'd be like, "See," and you're like,
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: "Oh my god, yes, we see one. I get it." You know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: we'd have van inventory that was so old that the we'd have to replace tires on it because it had sat too long.
Stephen Connell: Oh,
Alex: like the tires had expired and we're like we got to discount and get this thing out.
Stephen Connell: man.
Alex: He's like there's an ask for a receipt and you're like of course there is but you're missing the point. We're putting so much energy into this and then somebody would we would sell it and he'd be like see and you're
Stephen Connell: Right. Right.
Alex: like oh god I do see it but you're not you missed the whole point of the
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: conversation.
Stephen Connell: I think that I mean I think the point of the convers the point is like you could probably make more money if you put effort into other things.
 
 
01:14:50
 
Alex: Correct. That was the point.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: Yes.
Stephen Connell: That and but it's it's hard because it's like if his personality is like he does
Alex: Exactly.
Stephen Connell: probably doesn't want to waste and he see like you said he sees the value in something.
Alex: No. Mhm.
Stephen Connell: I know that's I know I've got that problem.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Mike.
Alex: I even have too much stuff.
Stephen Connell: Oh man.
Alex: Like Jim and I like to and I'm a little OCD about stuff too. And um you're like,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: "Well, those parts don't even exist." Like, I have all these old motors. They're not in inventory, but keeping them just for spare parts because, god forbid, somebody needs something that's that's doesn't isn't made anymore.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: And it's like, "Oh, I want to help those people." Well, how often does that come up,
Stephen Connell: I know. And it's hard. Yeah. Right. Well,
Alex: right?
Stephen Connell: and and then for the B like do you have the that personal compromise?
 
 
01:15:36
 
Stephen Connell: You know, for the business, it's probably best just to sell them a whole new new piece of equipment.
Alex: Absolutely.
Stephen Connell: Like that's going to make you more money,
Alex: Now the with the exception of the used like so like we have all these sailing track
Stephen Connell: but
Alex: system parts and used motors and stuff that are still perfectly good and one of the things that
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yep.
Alex: we were in talk of like this year is like we have to sell this this used stuff because we'll I've I've either obtained this through um a client's passing away we uninstall this if we take the equipment we'll we'll install it for free. So, a lot of this stuff I've I've already sold them.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: The only cost that I have associated to this equipment is that uh the labor to um disassemble and transport it. So,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: the so the profit margins in that is substantially higher than new, you know, but we can also offer that as a you know,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: almost, you know, 50% or discount, you know, and it's still it's good for both parties.
 
 
01:16:33
 
Alex: And the inventory of that was kind of a a kind of a contention because I was like, I need this inventory. We're on an acrruel system. So, we have to report inventory, you know, and um and we were going we got through the new and but I wanted this done and I wanted it done at the beginning of December and I was kind of like, okay, I'm going to let this I asked you to schedule this for us to do this and it hasn't happened. Hasn't happened. Hasn't happened. went into like mid December and finally we do like the new well all the used is where the problems are cuz everything is dismantled and stuff you have to go through it find boxes put it together make sure that one kit you can make kits out of those parts and yada yada right so he takes two weeks vacation so who's doing it I am so I'm over there for a week trying to put all this stuff together and again I probably was the right person anyways but it's not the point it's that The avoidance of it led to me through the holidays over there working through this thing that we have been talking about for months.
 
 
01:17:38
 
Alex: And this equipment as it sits there and it's not inventoried and we haven't gone through it can't be
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: sold because we have no idea what we have.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: I probably kind of know because I keep track of weird stuff like that in my head,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: but I don't expect other people to know that. And quite frankly,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: I don't and I'm trying to get to a certain point where that is also eliminated for me because there's I can't keep doing that cuz that's like uh that's just too
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: much. What am I doing?
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I got to somehow like say hey I don't need to have this in my head anymore.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Like I don't need to know that there's three gate system over there.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: One doesn't work and this one was talking for this and like you know it's like who
Stephen Connell: No. Yeah.
Alex: cares?
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: So yeah, that's some issues we're having.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: I can't imagine that everybody else isn't having those kind of things.
 
 
01:18:32
 
Stephen Connell: Right. So,
Alex: Um
Stephen Connell: I guess I guess the other half of that conversation is is how how much is it worth to fix those problems? Um because because an Excel sheet is cheap and
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: flexible. the huge advantage that like like we've talked about,
Alex: Right. Mhm.
Stephen Connell: I like saving people money and there's there's a huge advantage using Excel
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: because your your above average employee
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: can can do amazing things with it,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: but it also can create a system that that your average employee can't
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: handle, you know,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: and and it can it can create a mess. Um, but it's also can be very flexible.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: like you don't have to hire a developer to go change the system when you want one new field, you know,
Alex: Right.
Stephen Connell: so there's you got to find that balance. Um,
Alex: our quading processes.
Stephen Connell: but
Alex: That's what I I it has to be duplicatable, you know, like Jim and I knew it because we know the industry.
 
 
01:19:32
 
Stephen Connell: yeah,
Alex: It takes so long to have somebody to train.
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: I mean, it takes years to know that of just screwing up. And even still, we would,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: um it's an area that I'm like,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: this is not sustainable. And it's also just I mean if I could if I could spend the money up
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: front to do that then therefore I don't have to spend the money for the the wages for an employee to do that.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: Like if it's a simple process that's just like a
Stephen Connell: If it's a simple thing where they type it in and then it it pops it out,
Alex: Mhm. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: you know.
Alex: I I don't have to pay somebody six figures a
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: year.
Stephen Connell: I've worked with multiple resellers that resell the services that we do and and one reseller,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: he asked me how much something's going to cost every single time. And the answer is like the same.
 
 
01:20:22
 
Stephen Connell: Like we only do a few different things for this guy,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: but he asked me like how much he wants me to send him a quote. Whereas like the other the other reseller, he would come to me,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: he'd be like, "Hey, I just sold this thing for five grand. Does that work?" He's like,
Alex: Mhm. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: "You charged me five grand last time and this is seems like it's about the about the same thing." I'm like,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: "Five grand?
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: Sure.
Alex: Sure.
Stephen Connell: That that works great." You know,
Alex: That's how I operate.
Stephen Connell: and I loved working with him because he just he he wouldn't he wouldn't nickel and dime me,
Alex: like
Stephen Connell: you know?
Alex: right.
Stephen Connell: Like the thing for five grand, we could probably do it for 2,000 and we could definitely do it for 10,000.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: And you know, it's like five grand was like a a middle like a good amount of money.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: It was like a good job.
 
 
01:21:01
 
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Like, yeah, let's do a good job for these guys, you know?
Alex: Yeah. And so that's kind of like the way that I operate too is like give me an idea of what you you're pricing
Stephen Connell: So,
Alex: and then I'm going to go sell that and then I'm not going to ask for a quote all the time because that slows it down.
Stephen Connell: yeah.
Alex: So when we create a sheet for that it's kind of like averages and it'll average out because I'll get to know it on it was
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Right.
Alex: like oh that went up like 300 bucks. Okay. Now from manufacturers I get that pricing so we can make that adjustment. But then there's subcontractors and there's different things for instance like this.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: Oh, we do a lot of Cororey on, you know, those solid surface bathrooms. And I'm always like, just give me a square footage price so we can do this. And they're like, I'll just ask for. I'm like, I don't want to ask for a quote.
 
 
01:21:41
 
Alex: First of all, I don't ask for quotes unless it's guaranteed business. Like, I don't even do that from a manufacturer.
Stephen Connell: Right, right,
Alex: Unless it's something that I'm like,
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: I have no idea how to do this.
Stephen Connell: Like,
Alex: I'm not bothering anybody until it's real. And then I'm like, hey, I need a quote cuz I need to make an order.
Stephen Connell: right,
Alex: And so,
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: I don't like people coming to me that way either because it's annoying. like, "Hey,
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: like I ordered like, you know, shirts and hats, you know, more stuff for the field the other day." And they're like, so my the people I like, would you like a quote on it? I'm like, "Why would I care about a quote?" And you're like,
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: I always send them a spreadsheet and it has like model everything this and they're like, "It's so easy because you just send this to and and you're like, "Here's the quantity, here's this, order this." And they're like, "I'll pay the bill." I'm like,
 
 
01:22:28
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I don't care if it went up three bucks or whatever. It doesn't m It doesn't I need more shirts and I need more hats.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: No, I don't. I No, don't even b Don't even email me cuz that's going to annoy me.
Stephen Connell: Right. That's funny.
Alex: So,
Stephen Connell: So,
Alex: and it it happens with that.
Stephen Connell: yeah.
Alex: Like, I just got a quote for this um for solid. I mean, it's 19,466 bucks. I'm like, cool, whatever. That's fine. I don't I I kind of already knew what it's a oh it's solid surface the coron for this
Stephen Connell: For what? Okay.
Alex: bathroom but you know this particular job that I'm putting together for this thing is
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: going to be a hundred grand you know somewhere in that general sphere like so what if it's a few percentage points
Stephen Connell: Right. Right.
Alex: okay whatever um the joke is yeah it'll work
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah. This has to just work out.
 
 
01:23:17
 
Stephen Connell: It's going to have to average up. Yep.
Alex: out yeah it'll be fine and I'm not going to spend that much time you know you know tripping
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: over dollars to pick up 10 cents kind of thing, you know, like who cares? Let's just do it.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And uh it's like my big thing is is I can you do this work and can when can you do it?
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Let's do this. And timing and that and so I guess even actually working with me
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: can be a lot cuz I'm like that. I'm like let's go,
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yep.
Alex: let's go like what are we doing here?
Stephen Connell: I like it though.
Alex: Um, you know, and uh cuz you do you get like get caught up on these things and I'm like are you seriously just caught like um on small things like where I'm like we're just worried about
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: 15 bucks? Coffee is more than that right now.
Stephen Connell: Right. Right.
 
 
01:24:06
 
Alex: Like I mean now here's what I will say about that.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: One pet peeve of mine is ceiling track system parts. There's all these little shims and all this kind of stuff. Uriah's the absolute worst and he knows it and I'm always like,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: "Dude, you're going to give me a heart attack one day because I can't handle your disorganization." And he's so disorganized. He But you can't teach that, right? It's like somebody either has it or they don't have it.
Stephen Connell: Right. Right.
Alex: And his disorganization has drove me nuts ever since we were partners.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: And I'm like, "Each one of these shims $3.72. Here's 15 of them. Can you stop throwing them out?" Like, every time you throw that out,
Stephen Connell: Um,
Alex: it's let's just call it three bucks. I'm like, "Three bucks,
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: six bucks,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: nine bucks, 12 bucks.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Thanks." Now I'm getting irritated, dude. Because it always is like this. And he's like, "I know." I'm like,
 
 
01:24:51
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: and I'm like, "I'm just going to start taking it out of your wage, but I'm not going to cuz you know I'm not going to do that. I'm just going to b**** at you cuz you'd be like, I'll take it out." I'm like, "No, no, no. I'm going to pay for it just so I can complain to you and we'll have a little laugh over it." But I'm like,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: "Dude,
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: how do you how do you like on a job he will waste $150 of of these kinds of parts, little things like this on every job?" And I'm like,
Stephen Connell: Oh
Alex: "Dude, wouldn't you rather have the $150 bucks?
Stephen Connell: man.
Alex: Like, what what about if I bonus you $150 if you can just do this?" I've tried doing it. Doesn't work.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I've tried to pay him to organize. Doesn't work. Like I He's I'm like,
Stephen Connell: Right. Like you said, it's just not it's just not there.
Alex: "It's his son." And I'm like,
 
 
01:25:38
 
Stephen Connell: Not it's not going to be there.
Alex: I have just got to Yep. I just got to be the Uh-huh.
Stephen Connell: It's cost of doing business. Yep.
Alex: And I don't even It's just a pet peeve.
Stephen Connell: That's funny.
Alex: And I myself can still get on it.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Like I'm like, you drive me absolutely bonkers. And he's like, well, at least I'm consistent for all these years. I'm like, yeah, I know.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And I can't let it go for some reason.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And I am going to hate you right now.
Stephen Connell: That's so funny.
Alex: So,
Stephen Connell: Oh my goodness.
Alex: we do need to clear up the quoting system is the big thing.
Stephen Connell: All right.
Alex: Our building permit process is horrendous.
Stephen Connell: So,
Alex: Don't know what to do about that.
Stephen Connell: okay.
Alex: But these building permits are extraordinary. Just they're so difficult these days. They never used to be. Over-the-counter permits are becoming uh actually, you know, one of the things is I've asked so Nolan got pretty good at at building permits because I gave him this challenge and and I have some really again he's done some amazing stuff.
 
 
01:26:32
 
Alex: He's a great guy.
Stephen Connell: Who?
Alex: One of the things that he Nolan who just quit and um one of the areas they did is
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: this building permit process and he's done a really great job at at putting these things together. Now, one of the weird things is and I kind of let this go but I will say for six months I've been like, "Hey, train me on these. What are you doing?" And it's always like uh and it just kind of moves on. I'm like, "Hey, we got to schedule that." moves on. Right?
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: So, I don't know exactly what was happening,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: but I was looking at some of his things and I was like, hm, interesting. These are good, but I can't even I don't even know how to combine all these sheets into one PDF. Like, that's how bad I am.
Stephen Connell: Ah,
Alex: Like, I don't even know how to do that.
Stephen Connell: yeah.
Alex: But the building department wants all of these together as a plan set.
Stephen Connell: In one video.
 
 
01:27:28
 
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: Do you know how to do that?
Stephen Connell: absolutely. Yeah, there's there's probably lots of ways, but um yeah, I can think of a
Alex: All right.
Stephen Connell: few.
Alex: So, let me reconvene with that. It's just simple stuff like that. That's that's annoying.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Um, and it it could be just that they they need them in 11 by7 form because they're going to print them on their
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: side of things so they can stamp them.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Well, every time you do that or something changes,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: you know, it changes the format. Like there's an example. Like these are the things this I'm like, I don't care about the cost.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I care about the effectiveness. Not going to spend a huge amount of time on this. Again, if we have something or help or whatever, like I have an engineer working on these few things that I just picked up this week, and I'm like, I don't care what the engineering cost is. I care that the fact is is that the building department apparently had told us on December 15th that we needed engineering for the sailing track system and we haven't responded a week before even the holidays which was a
 
 
01:28:30
 
Stephen Connell: Oh yeah.
Alex: contention of where this building permit is and why haven't we followed up?
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Well, they're on furlow. Well, they certainly the f*** weren't on furlow the week before Christmas like and they and the date of the letter is December
Stephen Connell: Right. Right.
Alex: 15th. I could have had engineering on this.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: Don't care about the cost, care about the outcome.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Like I email the engineer like,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: "Hey, we got to get this done. Okay, here it is. I'll go to site. We'll change this. We'll do that." I'm like, "What are we doing here?" You know, like I'm not a person that cares.
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: I mean, you might know this a little bit about it's like, yeah, what the cost is what the cost is, whatever.
Stephen Connell: yeah,
Alex: So, kind of going back around to that ending,
Stephen Connell: yeah.
Alex: like these are some systems and that that I don't know how to fix, open to ideas,
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Well,
 
 
01:29:18
 
Alex: willing to pay for.
Stephen Connell: I would I would love to I would love to help you out with those. I think some of them I can definitely help.
Alex: Okay.
Stephen Connell: Um,
Alex: Well,
Stephen Connell: let's let's sit on this for now.
Alex: yeah, let's do that. Hey, good meeting.
Stephen Connell: I actually have some stuff.
Alex: We didn't talk about anything except for the VA on the website,
Stephen Connell: Do you have more time or are you out of time?
Alex: but um uh uh I do have
Stephen Connell: Because I actually have some website stuff to talk to you about.
Alex: to run, but yeah, let's talk.
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: Let's I got a couple
Stephen Connell: Okay. Um, let's see.
Alex: minutes.
Stephen Connell: You know, let me ask I had Brian did most of the updates to the test site that I asked him
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: to do. He had a couple questions.
Alex: Okay.
Stephen Connell: He's the walk-in tubs. I told him to remove all of the walk-in tubs. Let's see. Should he say,
 
 
01:29:56
 
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: "Should I just move that page to the walk-in tubs and merge?" Let's see. Best bath accessories. Hold on. Let me pull this up. Oh, no. I think you I think I can answer that one. Okay. So I told them we need that we need or you and I talked about we need to add Bruno independent living aids.
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: Lift up flex step is one they also use and should be on there I
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: think and the butler incline lift should be added and Bruno home elevator.
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: So,
Alex: Yes.
Stephen Connell: he says, "I'm not seeing the lift up flex or the butler incline lift anywhere on Bruno's website
Alex: two separate
Stephen Connell: or there are several different home elevators.
Alex: manufacturer.
Stephen Connell: Should I put them all on?" So, you know, I kind of knew he was going to run into trouble with this one because it I had a feeling that there would be
Alex: Yeah,
Stephen Connell: too many.
Alex: makes sense.
 
 
01:30:57
 
Stephen Connell: But that's the question is do you like which products in that category do you want on there? you want.
Alex: So, they should all be under lifts,
Stephen Connell: Um,
Alex: I think, is what we're categorizing that. Um,
Stephen Connell: yeah,
Alex: let me see.
Stephen Connell: let me check. We're try. We have lifts and ramps.
Alex: Yeah. So they
Stephen Connell: I think we were going to add his vertical platform lifts and we he already added all of the ones
Alex: should
Stephen Connell: from Arlo. Is it Argio?
Alex: r Yeah,
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Wow. Um,
Alex: don't worry. It doesn't make any sense.
Stephen Connell: I haven't looked at it in a few days and forgot.
Alex: Plus, I can't pronounce anything.
Stephen Connell: Let's see.
Alex: And uh um that's my one of my other hindrance.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And apparently my wife says I read fast like as in nothing. Like I'm like sounds good enough. Let's move.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. That's funny. So,
Alex: Uh so it looks
 
 
01:31:46
 
Stephen Connell: I think we've got lifts on here now, but he's not sure what of the Bruno and the lift up flex
Alex: like All right.
Stephen Connell: step.
Alex: So uh Liftup Flex Up is a different manufacturer manufacturer. So,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: LiftUp is actually the the manufacturer and I is
Stephen Connell: And the flex step is the
Alex: the product. Yeah. And so,
Stephen Connell: product
Alex: I had put that let's see website I had put that I put that as
Stephen Connell: lift up.
Alex: an update on our Google doc.
Stephen Connell: Is it a
Alex: Uh yeah,
Stephen Connell: Oh.
Alex: so I have a link on that Google doc to the actual website of lift up. Um,
Stephen Connell: Perfect.
Alex: and we could probably sidebar Butler right now if we need to. Um,
Stephen Connell: It's not a problem. You just need to know
Alex: yeah, I need to get some more information from them. They they're like a rudimentary company. Like they don't have like a a ton of stuff. Um, what was the other question he had?
 
 
01:32:57
 
Alex: But yes, they should be under lifts and ramps, vertical platform lifts. Both of them uh the
Stephen Connell: Which which document are you looking at? I see. I see.
Alex: website.
Stephen Connell: You have it open right here. It says new
Alex: Yeah,
Stephen Connell: website.
Alex: the new um I have the old link. It should be same link, right?
Stephen Connell: It looks like you're looking at the document now that I just opened.
Alex: Yes.
Stephen Connell: Lift up. And I see the links here. Perfect. Okay. Okay. Yeah, this answers all my questions. Let me double check. See if there were any others. So, walk-in tubs. We're going to add all the Arjo best bathtubs or the
Alex: Yes. No.
Stephen Connell: the Arjo tubs. Ah, yeah. And the best bath products is Beth Best Bath.
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: Are they listed here?
Alex: Um, they're not listed anymore as the actual pro because they're the manufacturer. Um, we just have walk-in tubs, custom wall panels, portable hygiene options, and accessories.
 
 
01:34:18
 
Alex: Um, uh,
Stephen Connell: Where where do you want us to get the information about the best bath tub options or like which tubs do you want us to
Alex: maybe
Stephen Connell: list?
Alex: that's a fair question because I'm realizing that they have a massive category now for that is so if it's on Best Bath's website, there's actually a um, hygiene uh, it's Best Bath's website is what it is. And it's under walk-in tubs. And it just says tubs is what it's actually listed as.
Stephen Connell: Do you know what the best path website is?
Alex: Best bath.com.
Stephen Connell: Bestpath.com. I see it. Found it.
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: So many freaking ads on search results now.
Alex: Ah, it's crazy.
Stephen Connell: I had to scroll down so far just to get to the best
Alex: Okay.
Stephen Connell: path.
Alex: And it brings up another thing that we should have. I'm trying to think of um maybe um under tubs and showers. So maybe we take the custom wall panel one and maybe we make that like uh barrierfree showers
Stephen Connell: your uh I I was stuck on a bath.
 
 
01:35:26
 
Alex: because
Stephen Connell: Best bath. Where where are you now? Showers and tubs. Custom wall shower panels. Yep.
Alex: yeah because they just came out with a whole new product line which is about to launch um which is a substantial nicer product and they're actually having these white showers So, I haven't launched it yet. I just got some information that they're going to be
Stephen Connell: Did you want us to rip off all the all the best bath
Alex: No, it's too much.
Stephen Connell: tubs and just list them all on
Alex: Like it used No,
Stephen Connell: there?
Alex: I think we I'm just just trying to think about that, too, because I was looking at I'm like, why is there so many tubs that they have?
Stephen Connell: Or do you want to pick like three or four and then we can just create a landing page that talks about how great tubs are and that we can help you pick the right
Alex: Yep,
Stephen Connell: one.
Alex: that's what we do. The only exception to that is is the RGO tub, which is not necessarily walk,
 
 
01:36:44
 
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: but the the panel that actually rolls down, which is on that resource guide.
Stephen Connell: right?
Alex: I do want to kind of highlight some of that because that's very we're a unique dealer for that particular one. That's the only one I really care.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: Best path anybody can get a dealership for.
Stephen Connell: Gotcha.
Alex: It's not really unique to
Stephen Connell: Okay. So,
Alex: us.
Stephen Connell: so we'll highlight the ario tub and but we'll also add some photos of the best bathtubs.
Alex: Okay. And then the Bruno stuff can be uh under under the vertical platform lifts. And so right now we have the max vertical platform lifts, you know, because that was taken from our website. I would like the Bruno stuff above the Maccliffe because like Bruno is a basically a better more profitable uh and a heck of a lot better manufacturer as far as advertising and stuff goes. And then Max Max liftgate below that. They keep doing less and less. It's even difficult to get a lift from them right now.
 
 
01:38:03
 
Stephen Connell: on the vertical platform.
Alex: Mhm. Correct.
Stephen Connell: Let's you want we want to move Mac to the
Alex: To the bottom of the page. Put Bruno and then put Bruno um above it.
Stephen Connell: bottom.

Alex: Yes,
Stephen Connell: want
Alex: I want um it's just basically two. It's their on their website. It's um yeah, it's just platform list.

Alex: But there's really, you know, it's it's it's Yeah, there's three of them,
Stephen Connell: but they have it.
Alex: I guess.
Stephen Connell: Yeah, but they kind of just advertise it as one.
Alex: Mhm. Cuz what's kind of cool about these is you don't have to build a shaft, an elevator shaft. like you do have to do modifications to the floor and those things,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: but the unit itself is all kind of like self-contained, which is kind of unique opposed to what we used to have to do is build a whole shaft,

Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: Um, we want to highlight easy access above Prairie View Industries. I rarely actually use PVI ramps anymore. They're just falling behind. And then under uh door openers, we got to open we got to put in open sesame door openers which far greater than this ones that we have on here. Far better. Apparently I was prepared for this meeting as much as you. Um, that's the quick notations that I have right now.
