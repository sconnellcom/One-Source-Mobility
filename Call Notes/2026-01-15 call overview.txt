CALL OVERVIEW - January 15, 2026
One Source Mobility Website Content Meeting

**NOTE: This call was scheduled to discuss website content, but the entire conversation was devoted to Alex's GM resignation situation. No website-related topics were covered. Stephen mentioned he hadn't done as much review for the call as planned because the meeting was moved up, and Alex stated he didn't mind because he was dealing with the GM situation.**

   - No unemployment liability since GM quit voluntarily
   - $10,000/month salary savings
   - Alex realizes he doesn't need a GM role - needs administrative support instead

5. Lessons & Philosophy:
   - Second time hiring a friend didn't work out (similar situation 15 years ago)
   - Importance of separating business and personal relationships
   - Alex's approach: fully supports employee goals but requires communication if goals change

8. Employee Relationship Dynamics:
   - GM felt disrespected and wanted to be treated as "peer" due to same age
   - Alex clarified hierarchy: owner has right to ask about project status at any time
   - GM took offense to questions about work status, likely due to self-criticism about performance
   - Discussion about employees projecting their own self-criticism onto management feedback

- Company direction shifting away from aggressive growth plans
