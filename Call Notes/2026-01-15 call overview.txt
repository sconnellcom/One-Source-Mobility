   - No notice period or transition/handover provided

   - Working from home, six-figure salary, flexible hours (8am-4pm), unlimited vacation

2. Performance Issues Leading to Resignation:
   - Scheduled review meeting for Monday 1/19/26 where demotion was being considered
   - Recurring problems with basic tasks and follow-through
   - Poor client follow-up and communication
   - Inadequate preparation (iPad not set up with photos, not checking inventory before ordering)
   - Field staff had no work for 6 weeks due to scheduling/project management failures
   - Friday conversation clarified employer-employee relationship vs. "peer" dynamic
   - GM quit after "stewing" over weekend despite positive Friday conversation

3. Specific Operational Problems:
   - Failed to send follow-up emails/flyers after site visits
   - Ordered inventory without checking existing stock (ordered items already in stock from recent inventory)
   - Made field decisions without consulting Alex, resulting in rework
   - Lack of project management visibility and communication
   - No system for tracking project status or scheduling installers
   - Took vacation time (1 week Thanksgiving, 2 weeks Christmas) while work was falling behind

4. Business Impact & Relief:
   - Alex relieved not to handle difficult demotion conversation
   - No unemployment liability since GM quit voluntarily
   - $10,000/month salary savings
   - Alex realizes he doesn't need a GM role - needs administrative support instead

5. Lessons & Philosophy:
   - Second time hiring a friend didn't work out (similar situation 15 years ago)
   - Importance of separating business and personal relationships
   - Alex's approach: fully supports employee goals but requires communication if goals change
   - Cannot continue pushing someone toward goals they're no longer committed to
   - Challenge was GM not communicating when overwhelmed or when role became too much

6. Future Direction:
   - Looking for administrative position instead of GM role
   - Focus on day-to-day operations support rather than high-level management
   - Need someone competent for client appointments, service visits, design plans, permits
   - Considering AI tools for email efficiency to reduce workload
   - No longer planning to grow company as large as previously envisioned

7. AI & Efficiency Discussion:
   - Alex started using ChatGPT to write professional emails this week
   - Saving template emails for recurring communication topics
   - Stephen suggested hiring someone skilled with AI for communication efficiency

8. Employee Relationship Dynamics:
   - GM felt disrespected and wanted to be treated as "peer" due to same age
   - Alex clarified hierarchy: owner has right to ask about project status at any time
   - GM took offense to questions about work status, likely due to self-criticism about performance
   - Discussion about employees projecting their own self-criticism onto management feedback

OUTCOME:
- Position now open; Alex moving forward without GM role
- Restructuring to focus on admin support and operational efficiency
- Company direction shifting away from aggressive growth plans

## WEBSITE & PRODUCT UPDATES DISCUSSED

### 1. VA Housing Grants Page Request

- Three grant types to feature:
  - HISA (Home Improvements and Structural Alterations Grant)
  - SAH (Special Adaptive Housing Grant)
  - SHA (Special Home Adaptation)
- Alex noted they don't work with these grants as much anymore (VA must use veteran-owned businesses for products)
- Came up in conversation with competitors asking about VA grant work

### 2. Product Updates Requested by Alex

**Bruno Independent Living Aids** (NEW):
- Add Bruno vertical platform lifts (prioritize ABOVE Maxcliff - better manufacturer, more profitable)
- Add Bruno home elevators as separate category (self-contained units, no elevator shaft needed)
- Three home elevator models available
- Bruno products should be featured prominently

**LiftUp Flex Step** (NEW):
- Different manufacturer from Bruno
- Unique product: converts stairs into lift system
- Florida-based company
- Place above Maxcliff in vertical platform lifts section
- Link added to Google doc

**Butler Incline Lift**:
- Sidebar for now - need more information
- Rudimentary company without extensive materials

**Door Openers** (Major Update):
- Add Open Sesame door openers ("far greater" than current ones on site)
- Add Auto Slide (unique - for sliding doors)
- These are superior to currently listed products

**Ramps**:
- Prioritize EZ Access ABOVE Prairie View Industries
- Rarely use PVI ramps anymore ("falling behind")

**Best Bath Tubs**:
- Don't list all discontinued models individually
- Create generic landing page: "Many options available - contact us"
- New product line launching soon (nicer products, white showers)
- Only highlight RJO Freedom Tub (unique dealership, panel rolls down, transfer-friendly)
- Best Bath dealership not exclusive (anyone can get it)

**Maxcliff**:
- Move to BOTTOM of vertical platform lifts page
- Difficult to even get lifts from them now
- Doing "less and less"

### 3. Category Restructuring
- "Custom Wall Panels" → consider renaming to "Barrier-Free Showers" (Best Bath launching new line)
- Platform lifts vs Home elevators need separation
- Home elevators = separate page/category

### 4. Business Automation Needs (Discussion for Future Web Development)

Alex shared extensive frustrations with current systems:

**Quoting System** (Critical Priority):
- Current: Excel-based, not duplicatable
- Takes years to train new people
- Needs automated system where selecting "ceiling track system" populates verbiage automatically
- Currently copying from master list every time
- "Not sustainable" - consuming too much high-wage employee time
- Wants to eliminate need for constant quote requests to vendors

**Inventory Management**:
- Current: Excel spreadsheet with quantities
- Issues: Multiple people updating creates discrepancies
- No integration with ordering/CRM
- Used equipment tracking is manual and in Alex's head
- Recent inventory revealed substantial used equipment in storage

**Building Permits Process**:
- "Horrendous" - Nolan was handling but never trained Alex
- Can't combine multiple sheets into single PDF for plan sets
- Building departments want 11x17 format for stamping
- Format changes break everything
- Need streamlined process

**Ordering Process**:
- "Sucks" - very taxing, too many steps
- Service quotes are well behind
- Master templates exist but still require too much copying

**CRM**: 
- No CRM system in place
- Need client tracking and communication management

**Key Philosophy**:
- Alex doesn't care about upfront cost - cares about effectiveness
- Would rather spend money on automation than ongoing wages for manual tasks
- "If I could spend the money upfront... I don't have to pay somebody six figures a year"
- Needs duplicatable processes that average employees can execute
- Currently requires above-average employees for Excel-based systems

**Stephen's Potential Role**:
- Alex open to custom development for these systems
- Mentioned most competitors probably need similar solutions
- Willing to pay for solutions that save time/wages
- Discussion tabled for future calls

NOTABLE ASIDES:

1. **NorCal Mobility History**: Alex and Stephen both worked with/for Ken Garzinski at NorCal Mobility. Stephen built their first website in college (~2001-2002). Alex worked there 2001-2002, left, then returned 2007-2012 until company sold. Ken was "HR nightmare" but they eventually developed good working relationship.

2. **Interview Story**: Stephen shared about 2013/2014 job interview candidate who arrived at 8:30am reeking of marijuana and showed portfolio of bongs from glass-blowing company (pre-legalization in California).
