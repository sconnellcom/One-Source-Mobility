One Source Mobility Website Content Meeting - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Alex: Hey, Stephen.
Stephen Connell: Hey, how are you?
Alex: Good Eddie. How are you?
Stephen Connell: Doing
Alex: Me.
Stephen Connell: good.
Alex: Uh, that services that you just emailed me about. Let me just take a look at that form that I sent you. Oh, shoot.
Stephen Connell: Oh yeah.
Alex: Where did I put that thing? There it is. Um, so the home access company, yes, we do everything on that first type. Um, the general contractor. Um, yes. And yeah, we do the handyman. I mean, you know, grab bars and things like that, you know, I would say that are but uh I don't really want to focus on the handyman service. I mean, it does give us it's good marketing for us like when we go install a grab bar um or something like that, it gives us a good idea to talk to them about additional services and things of that. So, it does it is good. Um, but I think that showing the other things and stuff we do, it I would assume it kind of um encapsulates that we also do that.
 
 
00:01:59
 
Stephen Connell: Right. Yeah, that's a good point. Um although if they just want to grab bar and you don't have
Alex: That's true.
Stephen Connell: it called out on your site, that that's something you do.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: They might not consider you.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: So,
Alex: True. Yeah, that's true.
Stephen Connell: I don't know if you if you do want calls for handyman type stuff,
Alex: Okay.
Stephen Connell: then we should probably highlight it if
Alex: Yeah, let's do so. I mean, it is a good good revenue
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: stream.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah. And like you said, it can lead to more work
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: here. Let me start. Okay, there we go. So, let's see. Another another thing you had mentioned a while back was that you'd like to focus on one to three day installs.
Alex: I would um it's it's um the one to three in this are like all the products. That's basically what puts this in, you know, like for the most part.
 
 
00:03:41
 
Alex: Um, except for any construction thing. And so, um, yeah, I I don't even know how we focus on that, you know. Maybe there should maybe there shouldn't Go
Stephen Connell: Well, you had mentioned focusing on like platform lifts,
Alex: ahead.
Stephen Connell: stair lifts, modular ramps, and those those sort of things.
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: Are those all one to three day insults?
Alex: They are. Yes.
Stephen Connell: Okay. So, I think getting like good landing pages for each of those is a would be a great way to focus on on those one to three day installs.
Alex: also ceiling track systems because a lot of them aren't as cumber they're most of the ones that are coming from the private sector are going to be simplistic one day installs um opposed to when funding agencies are involved and we're doing multi-room
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: you know we could have five intersecting different ones but the on the private side of things that's going to
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: be uh you know simple installs even h even half a Okay,
Stephen Connell: Gotcha. Okay.
Alex: door openers are another one day project.
 
 
00:04:56
 
Stephen Connell: All right, I have a few landing pages I got put together in the last week, but you know what? I think I want to spend a little more time on them before we go over them. Um,
Alex: Okay.
Stephen Connell: so let's plan on going over those next week. They just need a little They need They're
Alex: Okay, that sounds good.
Stephen Connell: rough.
Alex: Oh, you know what? We got to Is it possible Friday morning? I'm not going to be available next week. Is it possible to meet Thursday morning?
Stephen Connell: Um, let me see that. I've got I've got an appointment already.
Alex: Okay.
Stephen Connell: Let me let me check here. You can do like 11.
Alex: I can do
Stephen Connell: All
Alex: 11. Let's see. I come out of one webinar. Yeah. Right to the next. Yep. That'll work.
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: Be right back.
Stephen Connell: So, it's January 15th at
Alex: and 11. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: I just sent the updated invite. All right. So, let me let me actually ask you some questions about um about these two landing pages that I was working on.
 
 
00:07:49
 
Stephen Connell: One was for uh like ceiling track systems for schools. And I'm trying to put together like more content than just like here's the product, we install it. I I what we want to do for these landing pages is is kind of walk them through more of the benefits and and have it have it be a a better landing page so so we can get people to contact you, not just not just a product list. Um that'll that'll be a lot more effective. So, for like the ceiling track systems, um, can you give me some I'll I'll tell you what I've got and then if you could give me other any if if you think that I'm right, if you know if these are if these are good things to mention or if you have if you have um something else you want to say, just let me know. So for ceiling track systems for schools like why why you would want them would be one to meet standards two to improve safety save floor space because there's ceiling installed and then one suggestion from AI was consistent protocols to enable consistent transfer protocols across classrooms therapy rooms and the libraries.
 
 
00:09:10
 
Stephen Connell: Do do those ring true for you? Are you still there?
Alex: I'm still here.
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: God, I got a frog in my throat.
Stephen Connell: So,
Alex: Um,
Stephen Connell: what do you think? Do those ring true for you or Okay.
Alex: not not the library. So, classroom. What? Can you say that one more time? Let
Stephen Connell: Yes. So,
Alex: me
Stephen Connell: so like the this this section of the landing page would be like why ceiling track systems why why you would want a ceiling track system. Um and the first one to meet standards that's one then you had that you had
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: mentioned um but improve
Alex: Correct.
Stephen Connell: safety saves floor space and consistent protocols to
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: enable consistent transfer protocols across classrooms therapy rooms.
Alex: No, I mean I think that encompasses it.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: I think AI did a good job with that. I mean it from the outside standard it sounds pretty good.
Stephen Connell: Okay.
 
 
00:10:19
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah. I wasn't sure what consistent protocols what what that
Alex: You know what I have no idea but it sounds great.
Stephen Connell: means.
Alex: Um I mean but you know if we look at so for instance I was at a
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: um uh actually another we didn't do the project. So another vendor did a bathroom and ceiling track system. We were called in because the ceiling track system does not work for them. And essentially it's it and um this is actually something that happens quite often is that people may install ceiling lifts as other companies but they don't have the aptitude to train them on how to actually use them in sling training. So it makes the system essentially irrelevant. So they haven't used it you know in a year that it's been in there. And when basically when you know training them on instead of you know the answer was to take it all out and
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: redo it and it's like well that's not going to solve anything. We just have a training thing but we have to set up we have to set up protocols.
 
 
00:11:16
 
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: So the consistency between in this particular case that the the the family members and their daughter to set up you know the protocols that each and every family member including the other children and stuff there is a consistency with those protocols across so they can transfer their their daughter or sister. So when you have patients like in a classroom setting which for instance
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: she goes to school 5 days a week. One of the things I was asking about is in in her school is that how do they transfer her there? And they said, "Well, they do a a two person transfer." So I was like, "Okay, a deadlift, no sling." And they're like, "No." I was like, "Okay." So protocols like consistent protocols across like does kind of ring to me a little bit because like if you look at hospitals for instance you know each patient's different
Stephen Connell: Perfect. Yeah.
Alex: but the protocol of having to use the piece of equipment how do we use this piece of equipment you know how do we put a sling on are consistent protocols in the whole purpose in a hospital
 
 
00:12:15
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: setting is to reduce workers comp cases which the school setting is that's not what they're talking about But, you know, that's that is going to be the the um talking points to a point like Atlas Mobility, which I wanted their name forever because that was that's what I actually wanted the company name, by the way. Um I wanted the company name to actually be Atlas
Stephen Connell: was what?
Alex: Mobility.
Stephen Connell: Oh, yeah. We're Yeah.
Alex: Well, there's a company in the Bay Area uh in San Ramon that has that. But what their entire business model is is software tracking that the protocols are being met in the hospitals to reduce the workers comp rate essentially uh saying you're the um people that are working there are actually using the equipment.
Stephen Connell: Oh yeah.
Alex: So I think protocol does sound but
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Okay.
Alex: I understand what you're saying too.
Stephen Connell: Perfect.
Alex: I'm like what does that mean? Well I guess if somebody asked me I guess I could could explain it.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: When you first say it to me, I'm like, I don't really know.
 
 
00:13:24
 
Alex: But if I think about it, I'm like, no, that
Stephen Connell: Right. And that that's the thing is like I'm like I I I think I know what it means but I'm like does you know because if
Alex: actually
Stephen Connell: you don't know it mean if we put text on your side that you don't know what it means that's not that that's not good.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: So we want to make sure that it rings true with you. So that's great.
Alex: And then like you know a consistency of protocol could is uh maybe there maybe you got something we don't necessarily have to elaborate on too much but it might even be something that we do do that you know sit on that to reduce workers comp rate you know or something like that at some point because that is the point. I think I feel like I need a little more information on that like specifics,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: but you
Stephen Connell: Yeah. And and I actually looked it up while like while we were talking here and um and it's pretty much
 
 
00:14:13
 
Alex: know
Stephen Connell: what you were saying is is what what AI suggests that you know what that would mean like just making sure that you have protocols in place so that people know how to take care of of people that have
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: needs appropriately.
Alex: I mean, here's I'm on Atlas Mobility's website and under their technology, it's uh patient and uh staff safety is what they're referring to. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: And it says problem.
Stephen Connell: here it says like uniform protocols reduce ri reduce legal risks such
Alex: That's
Stephen Connell: as ADA violations
Alex: yeah, they go deep into this.
Stephen Connell: which
Alex: You know what's funny? Now that I'm actually looking at this, right, is that our solution integrates evidence-based practices, high-risisk, safety, yada yada yada. Um uh fac you know train position comprehensive classroom compreh there it goes providing comprehensive classroom hands-on and associated continuing education credits train your team that actually might be something I might do. Um our tech are able to capture leading
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: drag time. I'm like here it is. I mean this is not the first time that we've been called into uh help another company um with with a product that they've installed.
 
 
00:15:57
 
Alex: So that kind of goes into that consultation portion. It's always hard to explain, but kind of stealing stuff from Atlas Mobility.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: I'm like, well, it is stuff that we do training, you know, we don't have CU credits,
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah. So, that's what I've got.
Alex: but
Stephen Connell: I've got some of that listed here as well where I've got like on-site assessment and design, you know,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: comprehensive evaluation of your facility with custom CAD drawn layouts tailored to your school specific needs and floor plan. Do you guys offer CAD drawn layouts?
Alex: We do
Stephen Connell: Perfect. So the next one is installation and commissioning professional installation by certified experts with minimal disruption to daily school activities. Work during off hours or staged
Alex: We can do
Stephen Connell: phases and system integration.
Alex: that.
Stephen Connell: Seamless integration with existing equipment including treadmills, parallel bars, balance equipment and mobility aids.
Alex: They probably won't have all that, but um that would be more like hospital based, not probably in a classroom. But I
 
 
00:17:11
 
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: mean
Stephen Connell: Do you want to say do you want to highlight system integration and is there something that they would have?
Alex: these classrooms um are basic you know like they're real basic classrooms you know like they're basically picture standard classrooms the difference is is that
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: who is in there. So standard classrooms with the exception is that they're a special um special needs classroom um and they're basically utilizing that space to take care of those particular um students. So they need certain adaptations for just the you know basically I bathrooms you know hygiene care. The other thing that does happen is that sometimes uh for instance they'll do a more
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: elaborate like for instance the the project that we have on the website currently or you know that one with the ceiling track system. The reason there's a shower in there is because a lot of these people that a lot of these you know these kids that come to
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: school don't have an ability to get proper hygiene at their home. But as far as what they're going to have inside the classroom,
 
 
00:18:20
 
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: they're not going to have things like um you know parallel bars or anything like that. They will not they're not going to be doing any physical therapy
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: there.
Stephen Connell: So maybe just say like integration with existing classroom environment or existing environment.
Alex: Yeah. Environment. Yeah. I mean, the good thing is is we could write this down and then that gives me more time to look at it and go, let's just tweak that a little
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah. And I'll I'll send this over to you um so that you can review it more.
Alex: bit.
Stephen Connell: But I wanted to make sure we're kind of going on the right direction first.
Alex: I think we are I think we are I
Stephen Connell: But it sounds like it sounds pretty good actually.
Alex: think I I had AI write a job description, you know, the other day and that was pretty good, too.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah, it does. It does too. Well,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: you're like, "Oh, yep.
 
 
00:19:20
 
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: I knew all those things and there's a couple extra ones there like that was that I would have forgotten about those."
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Like, I know those, but I would have forgotten about them,
Alex: Yeah. I did. And I'm like,
Stephen Connell: you know?
Alex: oo, I don't even know if I want to do those.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Exactly.
Alex: I think that and I think exactly what we've talked about is that we have content that's there that says, you know, classrooms. Um, and we're talking about schools, we're talking about classrooms, we're talking about equipment in there, but we have to have something that's on the page. They're not going to read it like you and I are in,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: you know, as we kind of work in this and as I talk to people more um,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: as I've been trying to here is that I can just make some notes and be like, let's change this or I can go on the site and just change it,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: you know, and be like, let's take out this verbiage and put this one in.
 
 
00:20:13
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
Alex: But it gives us some sort of landing page which we don't have. Like I was just, you know, going again like looking at atlases.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: I mean there's a bunch of stuff that's here. But yeah, actually it's kind of a lot of minutia as usual. God, why didn't I think I Why didn't I mean I wish I knew
Stephen Connell: You're right.
Alex: software?
Stephen Connell: I know software. So, if you have if you have ideas, I'd love to build it.
Alex: Like this is like I'm like why didn't we build this? We're we're already doing this and they made a
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: company a software company that um does what we can already do. Damn it.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I mean, it it certainly gives me some ideas that we can uh discuss uh in a different time because this this may be um you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I don't even know what the competition looks like for something like this, you know, like or is there and um
 
 
00:21:32
 
Stephen Connell: Right. Right.
Alex: so
Stephen Connell: Yeah. The main thing is like having a sales channel of like how how can we get it? Is there are there people that would buy it and and would they buy it from
Alex: Mhm. Right.
Stephen Connell: us?
Alex: Yeah. Well, I
Stephen Connell: That's always been that's always been my problem is I don't have a true sales team,
Alex: mean,
Stephen Connell: you know, and so I'm I'm very reactive. Like when people come to me and say they want something, I'm like, "Yeah, I can do that." But I'm not good at going I'm good at I'm good at building it,
Alex: right.
Stephen Connell: but I'm not good at going out and selling it.
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: And those are two important parts of the business.
Alex: it is. And um so friends of mine that have been in in um software sales for most of their career and specifically in hospitals um I mean it's a very lucrative business um from the consulting side to the actual but everything is about
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
 
 
00:22:27
 
Alex: the software to being able to track these patients and it's it's quite phenomenal that that
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: uh the amount of money that they have been able to accumulate and I'm like god why didn't I smarter people. You know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: the thing that's kind of interesting, I was just looking at their couple positions. I know we're kind of getting off topic,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: but um is that like a patient mobility safety specialist part-time, $23 to $24 an hour and pow out. Uh um it's really interesting kind of like h I mean real basic things. They're basically training somebody to just go out there and do a quick little training system. Huh. All right. I got to look at this a little bit more. Uh yeah, the the the sales side of things. And I struggled with that too, which kind of led me to coming up with um trying to key into what what I need because we're such a hybrid because we're we're a tiny company. You got to be good at everything.
 
 
00:23:37
 
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: But the thing about that is is that's uh increasingly challenging
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: because you know if you really look at it like so for instance somebody that works for us too you know it's really supposed to be a high level position but if I look at it it's really like an admin position you know they're not out there actually selling they're reacting to what I I want them to go do you know they get paid
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: a lot of money to do that and it's valuable because you know the client interaction you
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: know being able to do a site visit, gather data, put a design plan together, talk to me about that design. But I mean, these are real like basic admin things. You know, you're not you're not coming up with a complex design.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: You're you're basically putting things together so that therefore we can manipulate it. You're doing the you're doing the work so that I can manipulate the project.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Um meeting with people, meeting with a client, but you know, project management,
 
 
00:24:28
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: but you're not really about project management. you're not, you know, really digging into timelines, budgets, you know, what really takes to be a project manager, you know, so it really is kind of like,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: well, I got to analyze this a little bit and then um you know, scheduling and all those things and and client phone calls and stuff. Again, that's that's not highle stuff. It's things that are important,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: but it's also administration work, you know.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: inventory management and those things like that. I mean,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: it's not like we're dealing with a lot of inventory. So, if we order things wrong, I'm like, how did we do that? It's not like we're ordering millions of dollars of product.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: You know, it uh you know, receiving organization. It's like, you know, it becomes it should not be anything in which we're thinking about these are just things you do. You know, I get a little frustrated. I've been frustrated a little bit recently with that,
 
 
00:25:29
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: you know, where I'm like I was on a site yesterday, too. And I'm like, okay, that's good. Why are we so far behind?
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: I mean, we got a big hole and we're we're expanding and we're doing these things,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: but where's the timeline? What budget are we at? You know, like where's the thought pattern? We're just reacting to this. That's not highlevel position stuff. This is just I could take anybody to do that.
Stephen Connell: Right. Yeah. Exactly.
Alex: I mean I mean from their perspective they're doing a high level position. Um,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: but that's really and and I say that to you, but and I try to really not I, you know, you got to kind of dance around that because people are incredibly sensitive.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: think that there,
Stephen Connell: Exactly.
Alex: you know, there's a huge value there and things, but it's like, you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: the thing about it is especially the workforce and even from a work standpoint is like I don't know like I guess years ago is like, you know, when you got paid to do a position, you did it and you did it well or you didn't and you weren't employed any longer.
 
 
00:26:45
 
Alex: That was pretty much it.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: Nobody pays for your personal problems. You show up, you do it, and you make it happen.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: nobody cares about what's going on, you know, and we've gone away from that. And that's partly good, too.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: I'm not saying that that was all good, but there is a certain point of like be a professional in any position that you have. And own it,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: you know, have ownership of that.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And uh, you know, it's it's very wishy-washy these days, I feel. And that ownership isn't there. like wanting raises, wanting advancements and all that kind of stuff. That's like exceptional, you know, positions and people and doing that. But people are wanting things just because, oh,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I did put in my time. I'm like, this isn't a sentence, you know?
Stephen Connell: Right. Right. You know, the interest the other interesting thing on that is like is inflation
Alex: Like
Stephen Connell: and and how that plays into it cuz like on one
 
 
00:27:40
 
Alex: Oh, yeah.
Stephen Connell: hand on one hand it's like dude you haven't done anything that merits a raise,
Alex: Right.
Stephen Connell: but if you don't give them a raise they're getting a pay cut because of inflation.
Alex: Yes,
Stephen Connell: And it's just it's just a really the whole system is very complicated and frustrating,
Alex: it is.
Stephen Connell: you know.
Alex: And as inflation goes up,
Stephen Connell: I'm like,
Alex: you know,
Stephen Connell: what the heck?
Alex: they're expecting and I understand that too. But isn't as a business, right? If we have the inflation, it's why we go into what we're um part of this motivation of kind of doing this is like we need more product sales. Like I don't mind paying like we pay substantially more than anybody that I know. Um, which is part of my little frustration, too, because you're like, go find go out, you know, look at this, $24 an hour, right? And I mean,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: we pay $35 an hour and actually even more than that for somebody to sweep a floor, you know, um,
Stephen Connell: Right.
 
 
00:28:36
 
Alex: let alone do high positions where, you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: that they're six figure incomes and something like we're a tiny company. Go find that really. But and I want to make sure that people have that.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: But we have to have the resources. We have to have the revenue. And I don't mind being, you know, a lowest paid person, you know, if it takes tasks away from me. But if I'm always also doing those tasks, well,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: then I'm a little frustrated, you know.
Stephen Connell: Right. Yeah,
Alex: Um,
Stephen Connell: for
Alex: and but if we can increase these products,
Stephen Connell: sure.
Alex: sales, and things like that, that makes a really big difference to the bottom line. And that's where sometimes there's a separation of that and it's like,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: well, we didn't call them back because it was just a grab bar. Well, what do you mean we didn't call them back? Who why would we have not done that? And first of all, who made that decision?
 
 
00:29:26
 
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: I didn't tell you not to do that. So therefore,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: you need to do that. And then you want to raise like what? Come on here. Money has to come from somewhere.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And so this year's goals is like we have to increase, you know, revenue is important. It's where we unfortunately that that we're going to have um increases, cost of living increases, everything's going to increase, but we have to also kind of work harder for the same amount of money. And I have to find out I have to find more money so that we can offset that. But yeah, it's it is it's it's a it I don't know. It's a scramble, man. I feel like it's feel like we're scrambling so much more than we ever
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: have.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. That's that's interesting.
Alex: I don't know. How do
Stephen Connell: You know, that the not calling not calling back because it's just a grab bar is interesting because it that that
Alex: you
Stephen Connell: comes down a lot to personality for the person.
 
 
00:30:22
 
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Like I know that's me right there is like where it's like I have this
Alex: Right.
Stephen Connell: anxiety about talking to people and like reaching out to people and and really it's like I don't mind getting on the phone with someone.
Alex: Yeah. Mhm.
Stephen Connell: I have anxiety about getting the phone call started,
Alex: Right.
Stephen Connell: you know?
Alex: Uhhuh.
Stephen Connell: Like once I'm on the phone I'm like great, but I I really don't like calling and missing and then they then I miss a call and we're going back and forth and
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: like or like scheduling call and then worrying about being late like all that stuff.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: So, so like I'll avoid stuff that I know I should do. Like for example, the grab bar where I'm like,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: man, I got to I got to I should do this, but I'm like,
Alex: Right.
Stephen Connell: uh, you know, so if you have that person in that position that's wearing too many hats, that's one thing that can be a problem. Like I've had to reconcile with myself over the last 10 years of like,
 
 
00:31:03
 
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: you know, where I can do anything, but I'm really good at I'm really good at doing anything, but I'm also not really good at doing a lot of things. Like if I decide to do it,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: I can be really good at it. like I'm a jack of all trades, but at the same time,
Alex: You got to own it.
Stephen Connell: there's things there's things that I don't like doing. And so, I will not follow up on them. And I like I think you just said, I have to own it. You know, I've had to really come to terms with that and be like, I could do that, but I really don't want to. And I will I it will be
Alex: Yeah, it is difficult. Well,
Stephen Connell: painful.
Alex: and there's certain different personality traits, too. Like for for instance,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: like working on things that you work on would drive me nuts. Could I probably figure some of it out? Sure. It's like,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
 
 
00:31:53
 
Alex: well, do you want to you want to update this web page and do that? Sure, I guess I could do that. But the reality is the amount of energy and um like my
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: brain doesn't work that well in that I I can fumble through it and I can get by,
Stephen Connell: Right. Yeah.
Alex: but it's going to take so much more time and then by the end of it is takes so much more um like just exhaustion, you know, because my brain is just not there.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Like even composing like emails are one of those things for me. So, if we get an email or something like that, I'm more up to just call that person because I can think through that process and do that kind
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: of a whole lot easier than me trying to go through an email process and go back and forth. And this happens with case management all the time. I like email back and forth. I'm like, I'm calling you. Like, that's it. We're doing this.
 
 
00:32:47
 
Alex: I can't do this anymore. We're,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: you know, I got half a day into emailing about something we could have solved in 15 minutes.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: um but I'm better in that.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: So therefore um but again you you need people that are also on the other side of things. So it's it's like that whole thing a company needs all these different personalities. It's just where somebody fits in that.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And I think sometimes we kind of get off of like well if you're not um you know in in hire management or you're not like um these other thing it's like I don't know it seems like a bad thing and it's not. It's just like figuring out where your roles are and even as an owner of a company you have to figure out where your
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: role is and um it's like doing field work you know
Stephen Connell: exactly. Yeah.
Alex: um can I do it? Yeah. Do I like it? No, I don't want to do that.
 
 
00:33:42
 
Alex: It And it's also like it's not where my effectiveness is, you know? Um, do I jump on sites and do things? Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Do I have a good time for the day? Sure, because that's my job is kind of like get everybody pumped up. Let's do this. Let's bang out the, you know, jackhammer out concrete today. Yeah, that seems great. Let's do that. You know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: I'll try to take on some of those things,
Stephen Connell: you know that that kind of reminds me of like of something my dad used to say.
Alex: but
Stephen Connell: So like before email, he had a secretary and she would like handle everything and just line up his calls
Alex: Mhm. Yes.
Stephen Connell: and organize stuff and he he would just have to make the calls and and he's
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: like now I have email. I remember this was something he was saying in like the late 90s and early 2000s.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: It's like now I have email and it's like it was killing him cuz it was like he was having to do all that stuff that he
 
 
00:34:29
 
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: saw as like secretary work and it was coming straight to him and and eventually I think
Alex: Yep. It is.
Stephen Connell: he even lost the secretaries like and he was a farm
Alex: Yeah. What did your dad do? Oh,
Stephen Connell: adviser.
Alex: no kidding.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: That's cool.
Stephen Connell: So he worked for the University of California cooperative extension in but county and
Alex: Huh?
Stephen Connell: he originally was tree well originally he was almonds and olives and then as people retired
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: he gained crops by the end he was like pretty much everything because they wouldn't
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: replace they wouldn't replace uh the farm advisors
Alex: which makes a lot of sense. And so like from an advisory standpoint and especially in that like probably where his skill set was is actually you know physically talking to people and farmers like getting
Stephen Connell: Right. Yeah. Like he'd travel he'd he'd look at he'd look at like some fungus and be like this is what you've got
Alex: along.
Stephen Connell: and this is what you need to do to fix it.
 
 
00:35:29
 
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: You know they'd describe they describe some issue with their orchard over the over the phone and he would he would have the knowledge to like fix it. And now it's like I don't know a lot of that stuff. You can Google it. And and he also he's write he would write books and like the almond manual
Alex: Right. Oh,
Stephen Connell: and and uh and do research projects and stuff
Alex: wow.
Stephen Connell: to share information so that growers could be as productive as possible.
Alex: Yeah,
Stephen Connell: But but anyways,
Alex: that's cool.
Stephen Connell: it sure it sure would be nice to have a secretary. That's not not something I've ever really had.
Alex: Uh I haven't noted either and so I was talking to a friend of mine too about that and um and they have a much larger company. They're engineering firm and they're about 25 million. I think they have six or eight offices or something like that. And we were talking about that and Mike and I have talked about it pretty extensively and stuff too and and because they kind of pushed him to um he's the chief operating officer and he's worked there for his whole life you know since all through engineering school everything.
 
 
00:36:39
 
Alex: So, um,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: one of the things though that he was talking, he's like, I don't really need a secretary because everything in which cuz I've
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I've said that before too. I'm like, I kind of need like an administrative assistance or a personal assistant or something like that. And excuse me. Um, and he's like, "No, I don't really what I need is really a a project manager.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: I need somebody that can take a problem in which I have own that and see it from
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: conception to implementation and not like if I have a receptionist or I have a personal assistance I'm basically just telling her what I could do and by the time I end up doing that I might as well just do it myself and I'm
Stephen Connell: All
Alex: like yeah you're right like sometimes I get frustrated like this week a simple
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: thing you know but it's like okay well this isn't done so I'm going to do it I'm going to make you stay on the phone with me as I go through this process because this is really something simple you should have done but if I have to train somebody to go through that that really basic
 
 
00:37:38
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: thing I'll just do it. So, I think the thing that I'm starting to come to terms with is like I do need I need somebody that is like really a self-starter um project management, you know, I don't know how to really hone I'm playing around with that a little bit, but I did I need somebody that I'm like here here's an problem, you know, here's a task and take that task and and complete it and not like because if I'm constantly involved in that then I'll just be involved in it and do it. Why why pay somebody? Um so I don't know what to do with that. I know that my time is very minimal. Like I know that. Um and I don't know what to do with it.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: But I was just, you know, I was at a job site yesterday. I stopped by and everybody had left at this point and they already had a meeting and I called and everybody was gone. I was like, "Okay, I'm going to stop by anyways." So, I stopped by and I talked to the the family and they're we're doing a bathroom and a ceiling track system and this is extensive.
 
 
00:38:46
 
Alex: like we're um expanding the bathroom and we're having to find plumbing in the concrete which is under the footer and it's pretty substantial like um the square footage increase and stuff to this thing and you know I get there and the family has a bunch of questions and those kind of things and we just you know by the end of what we leave and I'm like we well cool we've kind of solved all this stuff and I'm like wait a second didn't you just have a meeting with the three people that are here plus you know, like there I'm like, "Did any of this stuff come up?" Well, not really. I'm like, "Why is anybody talking?" You know, like I mean,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: like these are basic things that like I got out of you in 30 seconds walking through your door. And then that sparked this other conversation which then led to this how do we solve this to let's solve it right now because I don't want to follow up on this. to me texting everybody goes, "Hey, this is the changes we're going to do." And you know,
 
 
00:39:48
 
Alex: and then I'm like, "Okay." You know, and their case manager happened to walk through and I had known her and I've helped her on some other things and I was like, "All right, this is great thing." And I was like, "Okay, problem solved. Let's move on." You know, and I'm like, "How did a two-hour meeting before I got there, none of this stuff happened within the half?" You know, it took me a half hour. I don't I don't know what to do with that one, Steve. Like, I'm like, how? This isn't we're talking real basic stuff.
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: This is just general questions that they have. It means that the it means that somewhere along there the relationship um is not as
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: solid and I've only met this person twice. I mean these people have been on site for weeks. So there's some sort of disconnect like something that's there that that
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: is I'm not sure what to do about that. Um, I have to figure out, but that's what I'm looking for.
 
 
00:40:41
 
Alex: I, you know, I'm, you know, I'm I'm looking for somebody that can take take on things and, uh, I don't know it.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: I don't know.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: I don't know how to find that.
Stephen Connell: It's hard hard to find. It's hard to know if you found it until and even when you do find it,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: people aren't perfect. So,
Alex: No,
Stephen Connell: you have to find someone that's that's good enough, you know,
Alex: good enough.
Stephen Connell: and and and help them
Alex: Yeah, absolutely.
Stephen Connell: grow.
Alex: And you got to really invest in them to do so. Um, and then sometimes you just got to go, well, we've invested in this for a couple years and it turns out you're not really right for this position. I thought you were, but I was wrong.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: We got to figure out something else here.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: And um, you know, it's kind of like one of those things about increase of like revenue this year.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I was kind of opposed to the question of last, you know, it's like, hey, any ideas?
 
 
00:41:34
 
Alex: Oh, I don't know. I'm like, nobody's thinking about this, huh? Nothing.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: Nobody's got I'm not looking I'm not looking for like,
Stephen Connell: All
Alex: hey, I've been really I got a I got a whole presentation here.
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: I'm just throwing it out there and nobody's got anything. Nothing. Wow. Okay.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: So the positions that I'm paying people for is not actually I mean I'm I'm expecting a little bit more um ownership here you know like hey these are some things that I'm seeing this is
Stephen Connell: Right. Yeah.
Alex: I think where we could cut pack these are things where we could increase the profit margins these are some of the expenses you know that we're consistently seeing in timeline you know like something like I got nothing I just got like frustrated I'm like all right I guess this is
Stephen Connell: Right. Huh. Yeah. You're like, that's frustrating.
Alex: Yeah. And so, but then it comes into Oh,
Stephen Connell: Do they also push for wanting more money or or are they content?
 
 
00:42:31
 
Alex: yeah. Always. Right.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Mhm. Yeah. It's funny because like in the past like if I wanted more money,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I have a plan, you know,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: there's a business plan here and if I do what I say, I'm going to expect, you know, compensation for this. But then also I also expect that person in which I'm asking for money to not necessarily give me money until I've proved it.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: Where now Yeah.
Stephen Connell: That's that's the difference between like that entrepreneurial spirit.
Alex: Now it's like hey give me the money and then I'll show you versus in the workforce kind of coming up within our time frame it was like well I'll show you then you give me
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: money.
Stephen Connell: And I'm so jaded now. I'm like, man, I've been doing this for a long time and a lot of those things that sound like good plans, they don't work out,
Alex: Right.
Stephen Connell: you know?
Alex: Yeah. I'm like,
Stephen Connell: So I'm like,
Alex: good thought.
 
 
00:43:26
 
Stephen Connell: "Yeah,
Alex: Uhhuh.
Stephen Connell: I don't think that's going to work. It might work for someone.
Alex: No.
Stephen Connell: I'm not sure we can make that work, you know,
Alex: No. And then also I'm like,
Stephen Connell: so it can be tough." Yeah,
Alex: I've spent a lot of money failing at that. I just told I was I was meeting with a new company.
Stephen Connell: exactly.
Alex: They're pretty new. their um him and his brother started in their construction in their like late 20s, early 30s and they just got vendored for the regional center. So, they're trying this mobility thing and I met their mom and whatever and I I'm always, you know, I'm always for helping people no matter what. People constantly help me, always have, you know, those things. And so, passing that is is great. But anyways, what I was talking to them about is, you know, they had some amazing questions and all these kind of stuff. And I'm like, really, the only difference between me and you is just I spent more years failing. That's it.
 
 
00:44:18
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: That's there's no there's no like, you know, magic of any of this kind of stuff.
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: I just spend a lot of money failing at these these things over the years and go, that doesn't work. And uh, you know, you you start to figure that out and you'll figure that out, too. And unfortunately, it cost you money and I can't, you know, I'll help you and I'll help you with processes and and uh you know, understanding things and stuff like that, but I it's that's realistically it's where it comes. I'm like, "Yep, this we we tried this, we failed." I actually got really that's corporate really. Um, that stuff drove me nuts because you'd get another executive in there and then what would happen is you're like, we got this great idea and we're like, we already tried that. Tried that three years ago.
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: It m it failed miserably, you know,
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: and what's going to happen is you're going to, you know, we're going to go through this process. It's going to fail miserably and you're not going to take ownership of that and then we're going to have layoffs or we're going to have some sort of blame on something that's there.
 
 
00:45:20
 
Alex: And realistically, it's the idea that's what should be blamed.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: It's a s***** idea.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: Not that it wasn't a good one, it's just that we were like, "Oh, cool. We own that. We just tried it and it failed,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: so let's move on." So, I don't know. That's the stuff that I'm like I'm like, especially with the site. I'm like, if at least we have this, then I can start to um just I don't know, try to put out like what directions because I just need to diversify more and the you know the products are a great place for me to do that. We also need the home modifications. We also need the handyman stuff. We need it all. We need the schools. Like I was looking at a couple bid projects on uh commercial ones, you know, um which we've kind of gotten away from um and not just as there's only so much time in a day. Um but I'm like no, we need this stuff too like all we need it all.
 
 
00:46:19
 
Alex: And if I have some of this then I can try to figure out how to train people to promote this. And it is difficult and you know sales is really it's a
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: difficult process. Um saying like it's it's just it sucks but it is what it is. I wish that God fle this morning.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Um I wish there was an easier way to go around it but I it just there isn't. So that's what we everything starts with this sales unfortunately and everybody hates it. I always love when people are like you like it. I'm like why would I like it? I hate talking to people. And it's not that I like once I It's the same thing with you.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Like once I get into it I'm fine.
Stephen Connell: Once we're on the call, it's like it's great,
Alex: Yeah. It's fine,
Stephen Connell: but there's there's anxiety about getting
Alex: right?
Stephen Connell: there.
Alex: Yeah. I don't know why. Uh it's it's just taking that leap and doing it.
 
 
00:47:18
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And one thing that I often will will say is like, well, nobody's killing us today. Like if we walk through this or we make this phone call or we do whatever,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: like nobody's coming after our family. Like what is the worst possible outcome that we have?
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: Nothing. What? That they didn't like us? Who gives a s***? you know, like I mean,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: did did it go well that we analyzed the things that we said and we're not happy with the outcome? Like, nobody's paying attention to that. I'm going to pay attention to 10% of the things that you said.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: It's kind of like this website, right? And they're going to look at it really quickly. And I try to do that as much as possible, you know, and it's just like, yeah, nobody's, you know, let's put it in terms of that. like nobody's killing us today that I know of, you know? So, it uh kind of helps.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And it also helps me too cuz I can get in my little zone of things and then not want to I mean, even yesterday I was annoyed.
 
 
00:48:21
 
Alex: I was like, "What do you mean I got to go solve somebody else's problem? Why didn't we get the project to start with?" I'm like,
Stephen Connell: Right. Right.
Alex: why why am I being called in by a program manager to solve a problem for a vendor that you chose to do this
Stephen Connell: Exactly.
Alex: project which this is not an uncommon thing and um
Stephen Connell: Where they mess it up.
Alex: Oh yeah and pe you know so a lot of times what happens is we'll have for
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: instance program managers for like funding agencies and we'll be them we'll be too expensive and then what ends up happening is you know years later we have to go back and we have to fix it and I'm like, "So, were we too expensive? I mean, now we're having to do the project all over.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: Why wouldn't we be chosen in the beginning of this?" It's like, "Well, there was an expense and this kind of stuff." I'm like, "Okay,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: so what we're really looking at is we're not looking at people that are qualified to do this." So,
 
 
00:49:13
 
Alex: you know,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: history, education, all these kind of things. It turns out it actually does matter.
Stephen Connell: Right. Yeah.
Alex: And but
Stephen Connell: Well, and and the question is it or my question is is it working out for them overall?
Alex: Right.
Stephen Connell: Is it like a small portion of them are failing and it's and but the amount of savings
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: they're getting on the ones that work out by cutting corners, it makes it worth it?
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: or are they failing enough where it's like, dude, you guys really are messing up here, you know?
Alex: So abs.
Stephen Connell: Cuz it's hard to know like when to cut corners and when not to, you know,
Alex: Yeah. sometimes in um the other thing that we've had um uh
Stephen Connell: like
Alex: like we have I've had these conversations we call you when it's complex okay I appreciate that but keep in mind that we would also like simple
Stephen Connell: Mhm. Right.
Alex: things we also like again right don't just call us for that because you're
 
 
00:50:08
 
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: essentially using us so you use us in your pocket for complex things and then you give out all the easy projects which are high profit things to other company.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Well, how do we why?
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: So,
Stephen Connell: So in that if that's the case,
Alex: because I'm solving your problem.
Stephen Connell: you have to charge a lot more for those complex pro complex
Alex: Yeah, exactly.
Stephen Connell: projects.
Alex: And that's how we come into they're like your pricing. And so, like I had an agency that went back and they had a vendor that undercut us for I
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: mean I think I had 25 projects, something like that, that they wanted us to go back and fix.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: and and it it actually got to the point where the funding agency says we can't go back. We're going to stop the history at this month. And then they wanted us to go back assess and do this. And finally I got to the point I was like you know what no I'm not going to because every time we take on a problem for you is true you know the hopes are that we would get additional projects but it turns out you just don't call us for a couple years and then you call us in to solve all
 
 
00:51:10
 
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: these problems and then I don't hear from you for a while and we do we're not doing this anymore and the other issue is is that when we get into this and we need to solve it appropriately and right you don't want to actually fund for that either. So, I don't make the money.
Stephen Connell: Yeah, that's
Alex: Yeah. So, I was just like, we're not we're not going to.
Stephen Connell: frustrating.
Alex: Sorry. And um that kind of hurt us a little bit, but at the same time, it didn't because I was like, this is bad business. And so, I'm trying to be like, call us, and again, this kind of goes into this,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: call us for simplistic things, call us for products, and then also call us for these complicated things. We can do this all. Hence, you know, I hate to use the word one source mobility, but it's like there's there's, you know, we have that ability to to do all of this,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: you know, and I'll be honest and be like, can we handle this right now?
 
 
00:52:03
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Maybe not, but I'm, you know, you know, and most of those referrals, I'm like, you know me honestly enough that I'm I'm going to tell you whether I can or not. So call, talk it through, you know,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: but if we're the constant person that is always being called for suggestions, evaluations, those things like that. Therapists are calling us, you know, writing their evaluations. We're giving those particulars to them. So they write adopted. Then that goes to a pro and we don't even see that job. And I'm like, okay,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: so the PT and the OT's are calling us to figure out this thing. Yet we don't get the project yet.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: We don't get a compensation fee either. So, I'm also trying to figure out how to bill appropriately because I give away too much
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: and I don't know what to do with that one,
Stephen Connell: That's a tough one.
Alex: Stephen, because I just
Stephen Connell: and figuring out the because you want to be helpful but and in fact like for me it's
 
 
00:52:59
 
Alex: absolutely
Stephen Connell: like being helpful is like what drives me like I I that's what makes me happy.
Alex: Oh,
Stephen Connell: So and if I can help you for free like it makes me super happy
Alex: me too. Yes. Why is that?
Stephen Connell: but but it also is not so good for my kids you
Alex: I'm actually more fulfilled at Yep. No, it's actually where I am. Yeah,
Stephen Connell: know.
Alex: you hit it on the nail. Like I am the absolute happiest when I help somebody for free. And I don't know.
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: It's almost like I need I need the company running appropriately so that therefore I can do
Stephen Connell: exactly.
Alex: that.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. And actually, I don't have I don't have like a front like support person right now,
Alex: No.
Stephen Connell: but for for years,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: like I realized I had to because I could not I couldn't say no. I couldn't It took me a long time to learn to say no.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Like I if people talk to me, they'd be like, "Can you do this? Will you do that?" I'll be like,
 
 
00:53:55
 
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: "Sure." And be like,
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: "It's going to be expensive." They're like, "Well, you don't want to do it." And I'm like, "All right, I'll do it anyway because I I really want to help you,
Alex: Right.
Stephen Connell: you know,
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: and I get myself in
Alex: I do it constantly and I don't want to necessarily change that aspect because it is something that I found that I like
Stephen Connell: trouble."
Alex: about myself. Like I feel like a better human being.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I feel like it, you know, I don't know. I feel
Stephen Connell: But setting up the system so that you can do it and and and still
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: have, you know, everything work out is
Alex: So,
Stephen Connell: key.
Alex: I had an employee years ago at NorCal Mobility and um he came to me at one point in time and said something kind of profound and he said, "You will fight for everybody but yourself." And I was like, "What do what do you mean by that, Jake?" And he's like,
 
 
00:54:43
 
Alex: "I've seen you fight for me." And this is great. I mean,
Stephen Connell: Oh,
Alex: he was actually what an ex, you know, just a fantastic I like hired him as a general maintenance person, like just to give him a job type of thing. and he progressed to like a technician to a service writer to sales. I mean just a rock star of a person and um and I I I mean that was I don't know 15 years ago.
Stephen Connell: Well,
Alex: I'm still sitting on that and I still know him very well to this day. And uh it is really profound and it it is something that I feel like it's difficult in this situation. It is difficult for me to fight for myself but easy to fight for others and I think it
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: kind of goes in line with that um helping others and doing that but to my detriment.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: So I don't I'm not sure. Yeah,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: it's almost I need to figure out the I mean I wish I had a bunch of money because then I would probably just I the money isn't the happy thing.
 
 
00:55:41
 
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: It's it's the I think what we're talking about is the happiness and that supports it so that you
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: can
Stephen Connell: The money is I want a bunch of money so I can do the happy thing. Right.
Alex: yeah but I
Stephen Connell: It's like Yeah.
Alex: definitely need to support myself.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: So that's the thing I guess we got to figure out how to get,
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: you know, to a certain compensation or something of, you know, or uh net worth that that uh that can be the
Stephen Connell: And if you extreme if you if you like restructure your business so you don't get taken advantage
Alex: the
Stephen Connell: of it makes your business no fun you know like you have it's you have
Alex: Yes. Yes.
Stephen Connell: to there have been times where like I kind of lost focus I lost purpose like I had I had created the barriers so that I
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: didn't you know I didn't get pulled into helping people for free all the time.
Alex: Yeah.
 
 
00:56:39
 
Alex: Right.
Stephen Connell: And then it was like not as much fun. I'm like,
Alex: No,
Stephen Connell: man,
Alex: it sucks.
Stephen Connell: they're trying to find that find that is is key.
Alex: Yeah. It like even yesterday when I got pulled in,
Stephen Connell: Find that
Alex: I'm like, I can't believe I got to drive and it's not that far.
Stephen Connell: balance.
Alex: It was just to Elkro, but I'm like I got to drive 45 minutes down there to help this, you know? I'm like I'm annoyed at the entire process, right? But of course, as soon as I get there,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: as soon as I walk through the door, as soon as I start working with a family, I'm like in my element. I'm just like, and they're like,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: "Oh, we got to figure out how to compensate you." My immediate thing was, "Well, don't worry about it. We just need to solve this,
Stephen Connell: Wow.
Alex: you know, like I can't even help because in that moment I'm like,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I really don't care.
 
 
00:57:23
 
Alex: I just want to make sure that this is appropriate and we're not we're getting the we can move on to other things."
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: um this needs to be right.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: But my immediate thing was that like ah don't worry about it, you know.
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: And yeah,
Stephen Connell: the client the client becomes a friend and I like doing things for free for my friends. So,
Alex: God got to figure that one out.
Stephen Connell: it's funny.
Alex: Yeah. I don't know. Maybe we'll uh
Stephen Connell: And that's why that's why I don't know. That's probably why I like keeping it via email, too.
Alex: Yes.
Stephen Connell: I don't know.
Alex: Yeah. There is something about that too because then it's it's uh it's easier to separate. Yeah, you're right.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Yeah, I need to kind of figure that out. But it is funny too like I was on the phone with somebody yesterday
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: and there was a little bit of that anxiety. there was like some back and forth and this and that and I was like I'm just going to call this person you know and I call her on the you know heading up you know business 80 sitting in traffic and like as soon as I get on the phone I'm like this is great you know and by the time I got off the phone within two minutes I had solved the issues and had a a plan for the next meeting you know like here's what we're going to do this is the day we're going to meet we'll get this together solve it everything good like
 
 
00:58:43
 
Alex: yeah this is great and the conversation just great. I'm like, why is it taken days to get to this point, you know? Um, like where's the disconnect? Like where what's happening? Why are why are my people like not having the same type of uh inflection in her voice or, you know, like what what's happening?
Stephen Connell: All
Alex: I don't know. It's just something that's um I don't know. It it I was great. I actually was sitting in traffic annoyed with traffic and then I went to being like I'm in a good mood. I'm gonna turn on some music and sit in traffic and go home. So,
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: I need to also know that that's part of where that happiness comes when I'm like, I'm annoyed.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I got to return these phone calls.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: One of them's probably annoying. Um I was looking at um by the way that um the website again from um the product standpoint. So, the ceiling lifts looks good.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And then under the track systems, this video that we have on here, that's actually from somebody else, Dolphin.
 
 
00:59:51
 
Alex: Um, they're a mobility company, I think, in the UK, I want to say. Um, I don't know if we should have that on our website. Easy Track Hoisting System, uh, video. Um that's under product patient transfer track systems.
Stephen Connell: old.
Alex: So the so I'm not sure if that I was trying to find a
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: couple things for the what you had asked me the bridge systems and I was like and I had
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: and I got busy and hadn't really put too much thought but one one of the things the first thing that came to mind is like the bridge systems. I'm like what are we calling them? It's a gate system. bridge is not I don't think that's the right terminology. So I got to give that a little more thought because a bridge it's bridging from one system to another system via gate. So it's basically I'm like let me work on that. But then I saw that video I'm like I don't know if that video should be there. And then
Stephen Connell: now that looks terrible.
 
 
01:00:55
 
Stephen Connell: You know, I've So,
Alex: under
Stephen Connell: one thing I wanted to talk to you about is that what we've kind of got going is product lists on your on your site.
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: I don't think that's the right direction. It's the easy direction.
Alex: Okay.
Stephen Connell: We can just It doesn't take any thought. is like,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: "Give me the list. We'll pop them all on there." But if we do actual like more landing pages where it talks more
Alex: Right.
Stephen Connell: about the that actually and we can use AI to generate this content and then you can review it and see how it looks. Um but but that that actually sells the service more than
Alex: Okay.
Stephen Connell: being a a product catalog because the person coming here
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: they if we give them all the product catalog it's like here solve your problem on your own. Pick which one you think's right for you. But what we want to sell is we are we love helping people.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: We want to be there for you.
 
 
01:01:49
 
Stephen Connell: It's complicated.
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: There's lots of options and then show lots of options.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: But how but we don't need to show all the specs on all the options and and be like we're we
Alex: Yeah. The specs.
Stephen Connell: have the knowledge and the skills to help you pick the right thing and we're going to be there with you all the way through and
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: and really really be that you know sell the sell this the benefits as opposed to selling the features.
Alex: Yeah. It's interesting. So like um like I was just we do there's a couple updates on that like I got a call from somebody in Florida and we had eliminated the Voyager lift under ceiling lifts. So he calls me from Florida because he sees that we have this old lift and he's like these guys still have it. I said no it's discontinued. And he goes, "Yeah, that's what everybody says." And he's like, "I think I just need to um get a new one. I This was bought used." We start going down this thing.
 
 
01:02:39
 
Alex: I was like, "I can't help you from a servicing standpoint in Florida unless you want to pay for my flight." You know, jokingly, right?
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: But I was like, "If you" He's like, "Well, I'd kind of like to just buy a new lift motor." I'm like, "Can you install it?" Like, I mean, who installed it? He's like, "Yeah, I can take it out of the track and put a new one in." Just I was like, "Yeah, there's a bump stop there and yada yada." And he's like, "Yeah, I could do that." I was like, "Well, I can drop ship a lift motor to you." And he's like, "Oh, I'm looking at this Maxis Sky 2 on your website and this and that." I said, "Yeah,
Stephen Connell: Nice.
Alex: that's the new the replacement of that." And so, you know, I was like, "Okay, well, there's another example of like somebody found us all the way across the country for an old lift that we're taking off, which I don't want to leave on there because that's not relevant." But we get these random phone
 
 
01:03:17
 
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: calls that is like you know and that's happened quite often even like with
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: a with a sit to stand lift and I'm like yeah I can drop ship it to you. Um and I agree like we need to have like more
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: like what you're talking about and then we have this other side of things where like well here's a product that I found on your website and this is why I'm calling and then of course that phone call is what really matters for us.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: Um, I think
Stephen Connell: So, I guess I guess the question is how many of those phone calls are you getting?
Alex: let's
Stephen Connell: Because if it's like once in a blue moon, then it's really not it's really not driving your business, right?
Alex: uh most inquiries like let's just say let's let me
Stephen Connell: But say say on on unavailable
Alex: just Yeah,
Stephen Connell: products because that
Alex: not a ton. Right. So, but like um
Stephen Connell: that's a business strategy also is like we could list all the unavailable products and become like the place
 
 
01:04:17
 
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: people go for unavailable products and then you redirect them to the available products. But but you know,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: so that's awesome that you made that sale, but but is that sale tempting us to go in the wrong direction or is that sale suggesting a good direction to go in? What do you what do you think there?
Alex: I don't think it's a directive of anything, you know, like because we need a little like so for since I was just looking at the couple web submissions.
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: There's not many, but here's one for the Voyager lift. Uh, here's one. I'm looking at a this particular platform again product. Uh, here's a sling. Um, here's a lift motor service. Uh, here's an easy track system. Like, each one of these inquiries are uh here's another 10-ft RJO.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: Like, each one of these inquiries are all consistent with products. So it looks like our website is the reach out as a product with the exception of this,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: but that obviously then goes into an entirely different conversation.
 
 
01:05:27
 
Alex: So it's like the website is kind of driving almost like
Stephen Connell: But that's because that's all that's been on your website,
Alex: Yeah,
Stephen Connell: too.
Alex: maybe that's the maybe that's Yeah, that's a good point. That's a great point because nobody's calling us uh for an extensive ceiling track system or bathroom modification, you know, things like that, which we do want to highlight, right? We want to, you know, a lot of these bathroom modifications and remodels for accessibility is being um what's
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: happening is they're going to their contractor to do that and that contractor is just like, "Yeah, sure. I think I can do that. Why not?" you know, which we want them to call us because that's what we specialize in.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: Or we want their
Stephen Connell: where really you need like a land page landing page that talks about accessibility contractors and and that
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: that screenshot that you gave me where it talks about the different types of contractors and then at the bottom says
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: make sure you get one that's certified and then I assume the next thing it's it's
 
 
01:06:23
 
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: saying is like we are that contact us you know
Alex: Yes, it is. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: so let me let me put that on my
Alex: Yeah, that is
Stephen Connell: list
Alex: true.
Stephen Connell: here.
Alex: And in like a hospital um for
Stephen Connell: I think that that can be really good.
Alex: instance.
Stephen Connell: I'll do a new landing page for types of contractors just like that document.
Alex: Okay.
Stephen Connell: Go
Alex: And then like a discharge for a hospital or something,
Stephen Connell: ahead.
Alex: they call us specifically for equipment, you know, that's where they're um cuz that's a discharge.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: They need a piece of equipment, you know, but
Stephen Connell: Yeah, but how are they finding you?
Alex: uh web page.
Stephen Connell: Like they just searched for the equipment and found
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: it.
Alex: Usually what it is is because RJO is a specific um manufacturer.
Stephen Connell: That's right. You're the only sales.
Alex: Mhm. Yep.
Stephen Connell: So when that comes to that, it's like no matter what I do, that's going to be your best sales channel.
 
 
01:07:31
 
Alex: Yes. If I had my choice, I'd only sell RJL products and I would just I'd get rid of everybody and I just drive around a van by myself. Stephen,
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Nice.
Alex: I don't that's not that's not a good goal. But I mean it's sometimes I'm like financially like if I could just do that I'm like yeah
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: that'd be a good you know it'd be like a a thing to do later in life that I I
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: financially could afford
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: to
Stephen Connell: that's funny. All right. Well, I think I've got some good stuff to work on for this next week.
Alex: and then um I was just looking at the floor lifts and standing. We have the one.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: We got to take out the Sarah 3000 standing lift. It's at the bottom of
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Let's see.
Alex: products,
Stephen Connell: products.
Alex: patient transfer systems, floor lifts, and standing that Sarah steady standing lift. We need to add underneath there the Sarah Flex and take out the Sarah 3000 standing lift.
 
 
01:08:46
 
Alex: It's down below. That's one of the
Stephen Connell: That's funny. I thought I got I took out some of the Sarah.
Alex: things.
Stephen Connell: Let me Let me see. Okay, so say that again. Um I'll take out the Sarah
Alex: Yep. And then above um home lifting equipment,
Stephen Connell: 3000.
Alex: we need to add the Sarah Flex which is on that product resource guide.
Stephen Connell: Yes.
Alex: Thanks.
Stephen Connell: Yes. Okay.
Alex: And then um let's see what was the
Stephen Connell: So, I'm going to add everything.
Alex: other.
Stephen Connell: We're going to go through and add everything that's on the resource guide.
Alex: Okay. All right.
Stephen Connell: I I haven't we haven't gotten to that yet.
Alex: Never mind then. All right. We'll reconvene.
Stephen Connell: Yeah, let me let me I've got a bunch of notes on I I started the project,
Alex: Okay. Cool.
Stephen Connell: but I haven't completed it yet.
Alex: All right. Well, then uh then we'll discuss that when we're ready.
Stephen Connell: Um but I did remove
 
 
01:09:31
 
Alex: I guess you're like,
Stephen Connell: it.
Alex: "Now I'm ready." And I'll I'll leave it off until you're like, "Hey, I'm ready to discuss this now.
Stephen Connell: Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. I did remove all the things that I had listed to remove. Almost all. There's a there's some Anyway, there's still a few things, but yeah,
Alex: God, I want to That sounds
Stephen Connell: let's let's reconvene next week and uh I'll give you a better a
Alex: good.
Stephen Connell: better like overview of what's been
Alex: Perfect. That sounds great.
Stephen Connell: completed.
Alex: And then I'll have a couple other I'll try to put some time obviously to just general ideas and stuff like that. God,
Stephen Connell: Great.
Alex: this Atlas mobility company's driving me nuts right
Stephen Connell: And then Yeah.
Alex: now. Yeah. Kind of crazy. I just, you know,
Stephen Connell: That's funny.
Alex: it it goes back to the things that we just talked about is that the reality of the things that we give away that people charge for. We have a competitor, by the way,
 
 
01:10:21
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: that just launched another company. Now, this this particular company is called Rampco. They were in here. Then they started California Mobility. They they went out and got the VA contract as a VAowned business and then they actually weren't a V va owned business. They basically just listed somebody that wasn't even part of the company. And of course they got found out and defrauded the federal government by like 8 million bucks,
Stephen Connell: Oh yeah.
Alex: right? They did nothing.
Stephen Connell: Wow.
Alex: The VA continued to use them, but all of a sudden it just popped up with this other company that just came in. It's like they just and I'm like wow I have to it and it was like so what
Stephen Connell: Wow.
Alex: kind of leads to that is that I'll give them the tenacity in which they have I'm like I'm going to give him credit for that. I'm like they have no the ethics and morals they don't care you know his dad came out of like AT&T uh you know corporate you know relatively high up in there.
 
 
01:11:24
 
Alex: I will give it to them that they just don't care. they're going to find out a way to make money. And the reality is they make a lot more money than we do. And so,
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: and it's like I don't I don't want to,
Stephen Connell: absolutely.
Alex: you know, I'm not going to follow that line, but they are able to pivot somehow. And it's it's crazy. And so it goes into like all the things that we give away service-wise like this Atlas Mobility, they charge for like they charge, you know. So I just got to keep that in mind, too. But yeah, that kind of that was pretty funny. They just popped up and they became a vendor.
Stephen Connell: That is
Alex: They popped up as a new vendorship under a new company. And the only reason they know that is because essentially the principles are the same.
Stephen Connell: funny.
Alex: And I'm like, "Holy s***, same company. How did you get vendorized again by default?" Did did anybody check this? Like this is well known, you know, and it doesn't matter.
 
 
01:12:20
 
Stephen Connell: That's crazy.
Alex: And then the vendorship pushes through and here they're back on they're back online again.
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: And you're like, "Wow, okay." And there's nothing.
Stephen Connell: that's crazy.
Alex: I mean, we don't put focus into competition. You know, competition is always there. I always tell people, I'm like, if we if we're paying attention, it's good to know your competition. It's good to have friendly relationships with them. that's all good, but we don't try to like figure out what they're doing and then,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: you know, go on to defense. Like, do what we do, do it well, and good work will come to us, you know, but uh it is kind of a funny thing.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And then I'm looking at this atlas. I'm like, man, we got to figure out how to like I might we might entertain that other aspect of software. And because this is crazy. It's crazy that they're they're billing for s***
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: that I already do for free.
Stephen Connell: that is. So, what what kind of stuff do you do for free that they're billing for?
 
 
01:13:15
 
Alex: So like all the training like we do like specifically me like all the training and stuff that we do with therapists and things like that. We do all that stuff for free, demos, things of that.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Like it is pretty consistent that we're called out to, hey, can you help us in this situation? Um we have a problem with this piece of equipment. Can you come and train for this? you know, um can you evaluate for this? Um is this the right thing?
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: You know, those types of things is that and that's just, you know, it it network of what we have because we work with the therapists. So, you're like, "Yeah, sure. I'll help you out with that." Um
Stephen Connell: Right. Right. And that has value. It has value. So the question is,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: is your business structured in a way that you can give that for free and and and get compensated for your skills elsewhere or is it not?
Alex: Yeah. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: You know,
 
 
01:14:09
 
Alex: I have to really kind of look at that and uh I don't know just brings up a a
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: topic that I just you know for another day another another thought we'll get through this project and then I got to you know maybe dive into some of these other things and go what is exactly that I'm giving away
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: for free all the time and then and see if we can use that as uh
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: a marketing thing to give it away for free so that we get other sales. I'm okay with that too or Do we market that as an actual service and we
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: build for that too? So I don't know for another
Stephen Connell: Right. Right. And you know,
Alex: day.
Stephen Connell: I mean, it's it's the other thing is like, is it a good thing or a bad thing if you stop getting that type of business,
Alex: Right.
Stephen Connell: you know,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: like if they stop calling you guys out,
Alex: Right.
 
 
01:15:01
 
Alex: True.
Stephen Connell: would that be good or bad?
Alex: It's a fair point.
Stephen Connell: If it's neutral or or good,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: you know, like then like charging for is a great
Alex: Yeah. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: idea.
Alex: Yeah. And it is um Yeah.
Stephen Connell: That was one thing early in in our business that that we realized is like we were so afraid of losing clients
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: that we did things to make sure we didn't lose the clients.
Alex: Right.
Stephen Connell: And then and then at some point we finally wised up and like we're like, you know what, we're not going to do that anymore. And we realized there was a whole group of clients that we lost that the reason we lost them
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: is because they were not willing to pay a dollar.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: And it was like, you know what,
Alex: True.
Stephen Connell: that was actually a good thing that we lost that client because they were only there if I would support
Alex: That's true. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: them for free, you know?
 
 
01:16:02
 
Stephen Connell: So like especially around email, email support is it's a pain in the butt and people always have problems,
Alex: Yeah. Right.
Stephen Connell: but nobody wants to pay for it and and
Alex: Yeah. You know, that's an interesting thing you bring up too because if you go and you know, I have had those kind of circumstances too where I'm like, "Okay, great. But this is the this is how much it's going to cost. Okay, we'll call you back. Never hear a phone again." So yeah,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I need to kind of think about that a little bit more.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: Um, like I'm okay like so for instance like if we do inservices, I'm okay with an inservice because that's obviously we're doing a training, you know, for their staff which then promotes our our services and equipment. That's great. I'll do that for free all the time, you know. Um,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: but yesterday being an example of like why am I here?
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: Maybe, you know, I'm there because somebody needed help and they knew that I would come.
 
 
01:17:02
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Right.
Alex: Well, what about if I said this is going to cost you $1,500 today?
Stephen Connell: Exactly.
Alex: you know, would I still be going there or would they go to try to start fumbling through it until they really got to a point that
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: says, "Yep, we're going to need him because we are way over our
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: head."
Stephen Connell: And with the email with the with ours that that first group of clients that we decidedly lost,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: we realized they wouldn't have they wouldn't have paid a quarter. Like they would they would have paid a dollar.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Like it was not there was no there was no amount of money that we could get to keep them. they were there 100% because they knew they could get free work from us and they would be like mad at us for not helping well enough. So,
Alex: Oh jeez.
Stephen Connell: I mean that's that's it's not a it's just a a memory I have here,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: but you know, it's not what we're talking about here, but but just just like realizing that you're not in the place you think you are,
 
 
01:17:59
 
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: you know,
Alex: Trauma is is a is a great learning experience.
Stephen Connell: that Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: And trauma is definitely something in which I a lot of times I'll be making a decision and I realize that it's from a trauma circumstance and you're like why am I doing this?
Stephen Connell: Oh yeah. Yeah.
Alex: And you're like, "Oh, cuz I got burned on this or whatever." And you're like, "Uh,
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: is that the but is that the real re is that really what's happening here or I'm just associating it to um that and that often times I have to sit back and
Stephen Connell: Exactly.
Alex: and really yeah,
Stephen Connell: And think about it.
Alex: I got to really think about it and go and sometimes like I'll come to that conclusion of like you're just having an emotional connection to this. This isn't actually what's really happening." And um I've definitely done that and
Stephen Connell: Right. Yeah.
Alex: and gone wait a second you you've made up the story that
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
 
 
01:18:53
 
Alex: doesn't I mean it exists but nobody knows it exists and that's again
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: education and that's you know experience and it's all those things that matter that people sometimes don't see and that's when sometimes other things come up and you go well we're not going to do that because you know we we tried
Stephen Connell: You know what? That testing the waters is a a great way to move forward and and one way to test the waters is to put a price on
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: on those service calls and continue to offer it for free possibly so
Alex: Yeah. Mhm.
Stephen Connell: that people see the value that they just got, you know, and be like,
Alex: That's a good point.
Stephen Connell: "This was a $1,500 service call.
Alex: Right.
Stephen Connell: um we went ahead and line itemmed it out for you because of this other reason.
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: And that gives you then that gives you the power to actually charge it if they don't have that other reason, you
Alex: Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah,
Stephen Connell: know.
 
 
01:19:42
 
Alex: then we can actually what I wanted to do at one point, excuse me, is um there's a referral source that uses us for a lot of things, but I wanted to start to quantify the amount of free stuff that we give them so that when they come back and say,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: "Well, you're more expensive." Like for instance, we had a service call in Tahoe, right? And you know, now they're barking at how much it's going to cost. I'm like,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: "Well, it's not going to take that much time." I'm like, "It's a full day. There's no other way. You can't schedule anything else up there. We don't know what the weather is. We don't know what this is." So on and so forth. You know, like you're barking on the fact is is that you have a problem. You're asking us to solve it. And now you're mad at the price of it. Well, then don't Well, if we discounted to this,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: then I could get this approved. What? You know, like what do you mean discount?
 
 
01:20:32
 
Alex: You're asking me to give away our service rate because you had a problem. You called us. You didn't like this and now we're having a what? You know, like you kind of get into this mode of things and so sometimes that stuff comes up and then for instance this other funding is I was like doing a lot of work for them for free and I'm like I really want to quantify this. So therefore like at the end of the year I'm going to recap it and go this is all the stuff that we've done for you this year. my expectations going forward this year is I want X you
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: know so when we come to this know that you know we're not necessarily building this in this is
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: fair this is what we're offering you know and moving forward but that way that I had
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: more ammunition for the yearly you uh recap meeting which I like to have annual meetings with these people and that uh they understand where the value is you know
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
 
 
01:21:27
 
Alex: it's not just the specific projects there's value all the way throughout the year here and I haven't um I need to probably try to figure out a something that's there. It takes time but at the same time it's relevant.
Stephen Connell: It does.
Alex: It's um for instance we discounted that uh service for 500 bucks. So what
Stephen Connell: Wow. That's the other thing is figuring out how much to charge for something
Alex: you
Stephen Connell: it and then then going back and forth like if you if you guys wanted something on your website and I'm like yeah you know it'll take like if if the amount of time it'll take is too small like say say it'll take 15 minutes right I could
Alex: Mhm. Right.
Stephen Connell: spend 45 minutes going back and forth with you trying to come to a
Alex: Mhm. right?
Stephen Connell: deal and And then and then finally it's like it's finally like dude I I quoted you 15
Alex: I can just do it.
Stephen Connell: minutes except for now we spent 45 minutes like you trying to get around the $15
 
 
01:22:29
 
Alex: Yes.
Stephen Connell: charge and now now it's like dude I don't even want to do that 15-minute thing for you anymore.
Alex: Yes.
Stephen Connell: Like you you wore me out, you know?
Alex: We just had another case of that too on another
Stephen Connell: So that's that trauma. The next time I do it,
Alex: Yeah,
Stephen Connell: 15 minutes for
Alex: exactly. Like we had another case of that uh last week on a service call that's above reading
Stephen Connell: free.
Alex: and you're like we don't understand why. And again multiple emails, multiple phone calls. I'm like the the charge is what the charge is. Like we don't even know what we're going out to see. We have no idea. You call this because it is the lift is inoperable.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: Like it is down. The family needs it. This and that. Like I don't understand. But by the time we've gone through all this type of stuff, we're an hour plus into this just in labor. And now you're saying you don't want to pay our labor charge, but you've already we're already having all these phone calls and emails.
 
 
01:23:21
 
Alex: Those what you're getting paid for those services.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: You're on a salary. You're a case manager and those I'm glad that you get. We don't get paid unless we get the bill.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: These things are associated to that cost. I don't know what to tell you. And so, and then they'll get mad at us because we won't just
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: go. Yeah. And you get to that point you're like, I don't want to help you anymore. Like, I don't like what what are we doing here?
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Why are you mad at me because I won't do something for free?
Stephen Connell: That that's the exactly what I'm talking about. That's the kind of client you want you want to lose.
Alex: Yeah. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: because you realize like that's not a you problem.
Alex: No,
Stephen Connell: There's no there's no way you can make that work for your
Alex: I didn't create this. Yeah,
Stephen Connell: business.
Alex: there's there's no creation here on our part. You call this for a problem.
 
 
01:24:15
 
Alex: Like, you know, if I call my attorney or I call my accountant or whatever that is,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I'm calling them because or you for instance, like this is your this is your expertise. This is not my expertise. This is not what I do. Now, if you call me for the same thing, I same thing goes out. It's like I'm calling. I expect that there's going to be a charge for this. Now, sometimes, of course, my attorney will go,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: "This is not a billable thing. Like, you got this." And I'm like, "You're going to have to start charging me for an emotional conversation." You know,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: like it's like, "Ah, it'll work out." You know, I get that again, right? Our relationship is there because he knows at some point there's billable things.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: In the meantime, he's like, "Yeah, sometimes you just need that." I love that relationship because when I do get a bill from them,
Stephen Connell: Exactly.
Alex: like from a firm, I'm like absolutely that that's warranted, you know, whatever it is.
 
 
01:25:08
 
Alex: But there's all this other like give and take. And I'm okay with give and takes. That's great. That's relationships. But when it comes down to a billable item, like don't bark at it. Like I've given you, you know,
Stephen Connell: Exactly.
Alex: like you're not, you know, the same thing with my accountant or something like that.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: They don't bill me for all kinds of stuff, but we just went through an audit, you know, and that audit cost me $8,000, you know, for,
Stephen Connell: Oh
Alex: you know, and I'm like,
Stephen Connell: man.
Alex: I'm not going to bark at it. Here's your money. You know, it sucks, but they, you know, it is what it is. The agencies wanted this audit. You took care of it. Bill was 8,000 bucks. That's a real bummer. I have to absorb that. But I'm also not gonna call you and try to figure out how right
Stephen Connell: and being angry. I mean,
Alex: write the check.
Stephen Connell: that's the thing is I think there's there's a there's a group of people that have learned that if they are angry, they will get what they want.
 
 
01:26:06
 
Alex: Oh yeah,
Stephen Connell: And that's that's frustrating.
Alex: that is that's that is uh we've recently witnessed that at a restaurant, which I didn't even know was a thing, to get a free meal.
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: And I'm like, why would you go through that much energy to do that? Just walk in knowing that you're going to pay a bill.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Like why would you spend the entirety of the the the meal bitching and complaining so that therefore you can get a free like what an awful way to go through life.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Terrible.
Alex: That's just like it goes back to what you know where we get joy. Uh apparently they get joy in other places and I don't want to be that.
Stephen Connell: Yes. Exactly.
Alex: I don't want that's not where I want to fall.
Stephen Connell: They like feel all vindicated that they got what they deserved and you're like,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: "Dude, you didn't get what you deserved." Like those everyone around you now dislikes you and sees you for what you are
 
 
01:26:52
 
Alex: Mhm. You're right. You're a s*****
Stephen Connell: and it's not not a good thing.
Alex: human being.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: So, I don't want to be that, you know, but we do have to figure out we have to figure out how we can charge for these things. And it kind of I guess that kind of goes back to it's like we got to figure out how to charge this so that we can do to be able to do
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: proono work because if the money's there,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I don't have no problem with that. I mean, I I have no issues with that.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: But there definitely has to be an ability to financially give away, do proono work, do those kind of things because as a service and so maybe that is something we work on like here's the here's the charge for what we do but maybe it's a situation where it's like okay this is where proono at this point you know like they're like I really just can't afford to do that.
Stephen Connell: Right.
 
 
01:27:41
 
Alex: There's no it's like okay maybe that's what we give away for this time period you
Stephen Connell: Yeah. It's like, all right,
Alex: know.
Stephen Connell: but you know what? I want to do this for you.
Alex: Yeah,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: but at least we have the choice in there.
Stephen Connell: But put being able to track the value is key.
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: So that so that because where you will where it's on you or on me is
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: where you do all this pro bono work and then at the end of it you're frustrated.
Alex: Absolutely.
Stephen Connell: It's like that's on me for for letting you take advantage of me,
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: you know.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Whereas if you if you are tracking it and you're keeping kind of keeping people
Alex: First.
Stephen Connell: updated throughout the process at whatever frequency is is needed,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: you know, then then it it's I don't know. It's less likely that you'll run into one of those people that are actually trying to take advantage of you because you you'll just catch it sooner.
 
 
01:28:30
 
Alex: For instance, we had a case with a stairlift that we installed way up in Shasta County and um they ended up calling a company out of Sacramento to fix this.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: They never even called us for the service. We were unaware of it. Essentially, they wanted all their money back, you know, for something that we didn't create or anything. At the end of the game, I was like, end of the day, I was like, you know what? Here you go. I'm going to give you your money back. This isn't our responsibility. There's nothing that, you know, and I did that. Now, one thing that I did get is like this incredibly respon because it was like $7,000 almost, right? And it was just one of those thing I'm like, you know what? I'm going to move past this. And they were like beside themselves with joy of like, I can't believe that as a company you just did this even though it wasn't your I'm like, okay, keep that in mind moving forward. Keep that in mind as you talk to us.
 
 
01:29:26
 
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: You know, keep it in mind for everything in life. Um, and I'm like, this is the actual bill.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: This is what it really is. And I could quantify that.
Stephen Connell: Right,
Alex: It was still awful,
Stephen Connell: man. That's
Alex: but I moved past it.
Stephen Connell: crazy.
Alex: It's still trauma, obviously. I just used the story, but I've done that more times than I can think of,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: you know, and just been like, "Okay, fine." But then you have those people that no matter what you do, they're they'll just keep coming back and keep coming back and want more.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: Um, so I have to be cautious with that going forward of how I do that. I'm like, "This solves it, right?
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: We're good.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: We're fine. We didn't create this. Know that this is what Right." And then we have the other people like I have one currently.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: They're not the funer. You know, the family is just everything is great, right?
 
 
01:30:31
 
Alex: there's no problems,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: but they keep creating these problems that don't exist. And so therefore, what's happened is what what really is happening is they don't if they if they continue to have problems, we'll keep coming back and then they'll add things while we're there, right?
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: So, they don't actually want a solution for this because if they if they have a solution,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: you know, we we're never coming back and that's not what they want. So every time you show up, they're like, "Hey, Ann, can you look at this? Hey, can you look at this?" And those are those people you're like,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: "We have to have an ending here." And
Stephen Connell: That's where you have to like charge them extra. Like if you just charged them extra for that just once,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: it would stop, you know,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: be like, "No problem." And then send him a
Alex: Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Stephen Connell: bill.
Alex: And it'd be funny if uh if you ever get ever actually get it.
 
 
01:31:23
 
Alex: Like I've had situations like that too where like for instance like uh this family owed me over $14,000. Didn't pay. Didn't pay. Didn't pay. They tried to like so they had some issues with the it was a ceiling lift and they tried to go out to competitors which called me and was like hey this seems like your system like yep they owe me this money. They're like okay we're not working with them. Eventually he calls back and he's like I'll give you a 10.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And I'm like the bill's 14 or whatever. and he's like, "I'll give you 10." And I'm like, "Why are we negotiating like two years later,
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: you know, we'll come and fix my lift." I'm like, "What?" Uh, eventually he did send me a check for 10.
Stephen Connell: man.
Alex: And I was like, "Yep, we we won't speak again." Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: So,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: it's crazy, man.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I don't really know these. It's It's just It's really frustrating,
Stephen Connell: Oh.
Alex: but I try not to focus on those frustrations and just move forward and be like, "This is what we got. This is how we can change things." moving forward.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I can't do anything of the past. Um, let's let's make this happen in the future. So,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I don't know. We'll see. But this person's calling us. She's an uh nurse case manager. I was just looking at a voicemail that just came through. This is about a ramp. for instance. So that's why she's calling us. Probably a modular ramp is why she is. I'll keep track of some of this stuff. All right. Okay. Sounds good. Have a good weekend. Thanks, Stephen. Appreciate it. Same here, buddy. Always appreciate our talks. All right. Bye.
