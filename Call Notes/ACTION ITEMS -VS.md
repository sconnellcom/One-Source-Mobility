   - Hide gross profit information from some users
   - "Not sustainable" in current form

2. **Inventory Management System**

   - Prevent multiple-user conflicts
   - Track: equipment, used inventory, rentals, tools, office, vehicle
   - Integration with ordering/CRM

3. **Building Permit Document Management**

   - Maintain 11x17 format for building department stamping
   - Automated format handling

4. **CRM System**
