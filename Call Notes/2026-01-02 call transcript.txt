Stephen Connell: Morning, Alex. Morning, Alex. I hear you.

Stephen Connell: Good morning.
Alex: You feeling better?
Stephen Connell: Yeah, doing a lot better.
Alex: Happy New Year.
Stephen Connell: Thanks. You too.
Alex: I'm doing well.
Stephen Connell: How are you doing?
Alex: Hopefully uh staying away from whatever you got.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah, I got it. I think I got on the airplane coming back from California and then like I got it twice,
Alex: Oh,
Stephen Connell: man. I got I got sick and then I finally I got over it. Wasn't too bad. Then my kid got it. Then my other kid got it and then they gave it back to me. I was like, "Oh man."
Alex: dude. Um,
Stephen Connell: And
Alex: I'm like really um uh skittish right now, I guess, about being sick because Lindsay and I got sick um like this summer.
Stephen Connell: yeah.
Alex: We got sick for basically almost all summer. Um like I was sick for I don't know a month at least.
 
 
00:03:02
 
Stephen Connell: Oh.
Alex: Then she got it and then then this was in Maine. We get back to California. Within like a month we get sick again. Then we got over that. Then we got sick again. It was like three or four. It was almost to like somewhere end of October and uh it was just bizarre. It was like the same thing. As soon as you got over it, you got it again.
Stephen Connell: Oh man.
Alex: Whatever it or another version or something like that.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Yeah, it was crazy.
Stephen Connell: Yep. That is crazy.
Alex: I was completely uh pretty frustrated because I'm very much like if you're sick, I'm like get the f*** away from me.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah. My wife was like She was like not happy about it. I I flew to California by myself to see my family and uh so I was only there for like four days and I came back and then the family's had to deal with this for
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: the last month.
 
 
00:04:02
 
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: So, and she's been she's been pretty
Alex: That's uh Yeah,
Stephen Connell: skittish.
Alex: it's uh we uh I went over to uh a friend's across the street, neighbor And uh I was having a couple cocktails over here and they were doing that. So I went over and then uh Casey uh his Matt's wife, whatever, was completely sick. Like really sick. And I'm like,
Stephen Connell: Oh,
Alex: what are you doing? Like why am I here?
Stephen Connell: you're like, "No,
Alex: What? No,
Stephen Connell: no,
Alex: I'm leaving. And she's like, I'm fine. It's been a couple days. I'm like,
Stephen Connell: yeah." Yeah.
Alex: you can't even talk.
Stephen Connell: You're like, "Uh-uh. No, no,
Alex: No, I would have gladly just stayed right at my house and went to sleep.
Stephen Connell: I know."
Alex: Uh, but anyways,
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: well, that's good.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. I mean, I want I wanted my family had a big get together like right before the weekend before Christmas,
Alex: Uh,
Stephen Connell: and that's when I wanted to go, but my wife was like, "No way." Like,
 
 
00:04:59
 
Stephen Connell: you come back from that,
Alex: yeah.
Stephen Connell: you know, someone in your family is going to show up sick because it's like a big extended family and someone always does and gets everyone sick, you know? And so she's like,
Alex: Oh my gosh, that sucked.
Stephen Connell: "You can't go to that one." Ironically, if I done that, then we wouldn't have been sick on Christmas because it wouldn't have hit my family for like another week. But but and and then sure enough like one of my cousins posts like she's like half my family's sick so they're staying home but I'm going looking forward to seeing you all. And my wife was like see that's why you're not going. I'm like dang it.
Alex: Yes.
Stephen Connell: Yep. It's like what is she doing? Like it's like one of her kids is really sick but the other one and hers they're fine. Like she like no you guys just aren't showing yet.
Alex: Yeah. Yeah. We um
Stephen Connell: So, or like allergies. My family will be like,
 
 
00:05:50
 
Alex: you
Stephen Connell: "We have it's just allergies." It's like, "No, it's not. It's not just allergies.
Alex: No.
Stephen Connell: You know better than that." Yep.
Alex: Yeah. I like that. Everybody always says that, too. Is this allergies? I'm like, "No,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: not no you're not. You're sick.
Stephen Connell: No, you're sick.
Alex: This is it's okay to just say you're sick.
Stephen Connell: Yep. Yeah. Yep.
Alex: Like even even um like work like everybody knows like I'm glad to pay you to go home. Um like it it this is not a conversation you know just leave and
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: uh and especially with our clientele like you can't be around them sick
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: and we got people in ventilators. I mean,
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: we have very very uh susceptible children and and adults and
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: so but uh they'll still show up like it's a bride,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: like a like a pride thing or something like that.
 
 
00:06:41
 
Alex: And I'm like, you know what would be great?
Stephen Connell: Right. They're all proud of themselves.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: If you would take that pride in your every everyday work,
Stephen Connell: Like, no. No.
Alex: we would be a lot further
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: ahead.
Stephen Connell: That's funny. Yep. Oh, man. Well,
Alex: Um,
Stephen Connell: I'm glad you're feeling good.
Alex: yeah, I'm glad you are, too. Uh, I see that we have Okay,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: so I'm just on the um website right now. And then we have the home modifications and the rentals and and I got to start adding I just made a list of um additional manufacturers that I need to add underneath the products. Um, and there's a couple really kind of good things I want to add to
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: this cuz I was noticing like some of the um, uh, lifts and ramps is one category there. And then where it says porch lifts um, which are named, but they're basically vertical platform lifts. And then we only have one manufacturer, but we have three.
 
 
00:07:48
 
Alex: And one of them is kind of a cool product out of Florida that takes steps and basically converts a staircase into a lift in back.
Stephen Connell: Oh,
Alex: So yeah,
Stephen Connell: well
Alex: and then one of the major manufacturers that we actually work with isn't even on there. So and what did I do with this
Stephen Connell: you
Alex: list? So, I just was noticing that. And then our rental actually went through our rental inventory um this week, which we have quite a bit of it. So, we're going to have to push these rentals this year cuz when I inventory when I inventory the product and it's sitting in storage,
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Mhm.
Alex: that's not good. And all right,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: let's see marketing and yeah, I got to get all these things that um which I think will be added to one, two, three. They can be added under lifts, those manufacturers. Um, let's see. Uh, one thing I noticed about the home modifications is I got to come up with an um another picture.
 
 
00:09:33
 
Alex: Like we have a ceiling track one that's uh it's basically two down on the right. It's just a ceiling track. Although I actually don't mind that picture, but there's really no before and after on it.
Stephen Connell: right? It's two different
Alex: It's just a Mhm.
Stephen Connell: before.
Alex: which I could just come up with another project for that.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And then under the rental tab, um the current rental, go back to our
Stephen Connell: We could probably Photoshop it if you wanted if you wanted to like have a before and
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: after without the
Alex: Well, technically Well, technically I probably do.
Stephen Connell: lift.
Alex: Let me Maybe that was actually Gridly School.
Stephen Connell: Yeah, because these are simple enough. I think we could do that.
Alex: Mhm. Yeah. Okay. That would be cool because then it does show like a lift and it is kind of a neat bathroom.
Stephen Connell: Okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's good.
Alex: And one of the other things I want to um is that's a school project
 
 
00:10:44
 
Stephen Connell: It's a good good one for that.
Alex: and I want to kind of highlight somewhere somewhere that we do schools.
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: So, um, let me Oh, I have a bunch of pictures of it under construction. So, every special education classroom that is now built has to has to have a ceiling track
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: system. So, yeah.
Stephen Connell: Wow.
Alex: So, it's kind of a unique thing. Um, but I want to somehow market obviously our services to that because generally what happens is the um they're going to the the bid is going to be awarded to like some general contractor that's going to be um building off the addition or
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: addition to the school and then they're going to call us.
Stephen Connell: Gotcha.
Alex: But I got to get to those people cuz there's a lot of those are going up and we didn't get them ready for breakfast. So that's one that's what I want to do on that. Don't know where that kind of fits in but yeah Photoshop would be fine.
Stephen Connell: I I'll see about putting together a landing page for schools.
 
 
00:12:14
 
Alex: Okay.
Stephen Connell: Do you want Do you want to focus on just ceiling track systems or what other what other systems might they
Alex: Any uh that that would be it.
Stephen Connell: need?
Alex: That's all that we can provide to
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: them. And then I needed to make some updates on tubs. I noticed that. What was that? Let me get to that. So, I might as well just kind of go down this. As I say, I think maybe that by having a landing page, I might be able to get some more information back to you. But under ceiling lifts, like ceiling lifts,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: the first one, RJO, the original portable lift, they don't make that anymore. Um, so the RGO Maxi Sky 440 is not the newest upgrade. It is the only option. Um, the fixed track ceiling lifts.
Stephen Connell: Okay, hold on. Let me let me find where that one was. Where
Alex: Okay.
Stephen Connell: uh it was on the ceiling lift page.
Alex: Correct.
Stephen Connell: And which one don't they make anymore?
 
 
00:13:34
 
Alex: The very first one, the under portable lifts.
Stephen Connell: Vo the Voyager.
Alex: Yeah. Yes. So, the Argo Voyager, the original portable,
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: is discontinued. The RJO Maxis Sky 440 is not the newest. It's just is the We could take the newest out
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: under fixed track systems.
Stephen Connell: Gotcha.
Alex: The fixed track ceiling lifts the RJO Voyager Duo there, that's discontinued, too. So, the Maxi Sky 2 is the only current
Stephen Connell: Okay. Hold on. almost there on um which one was the next one? The Voyager duo.
Alex: Correct.
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: The Maxi Sky, the RGO Maxi Sky 2,
Stephen Connell: And
Alex: which is the next one, that's the only lift they make.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: So,
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: they do not make they do not make the Maxis Sky 600 and they do not make the Maxi Sky 1000. So, there's basically just two lifts there now. Um, I need to check something really quick
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: actually because this goes into schools. Normally, they make a,000 lb capacity lift.
 
 
00:14:59
 
Alex: We don't generally do those. Um, but every once in a while that might come up. They make all these versions of this thing which we don't need. I just needed to check this. I wanted to check if I was crazy. Uh, okay. I'm sorry. So, they still are making the Maxi Sky 1,000. That's what I did want to check.
Stephen Connell: Okay. So, I'll keep that
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: one.
Alex: What they do is they add to to for a barrier thousand pound capacity.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: They actually we have an ability to add two of those Maxi Sky lift motors together on a ceiling lift. That's what you end up mostly doing. Um you lift them in a certain way. So that Maxis Sky 1000 is rar I don't think I've ever even seen one, but in a commercial project it might be requested. So we'll leave that. All right.
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: Jeez. I don't look at that very often. So, I was like, I need to see if I'm crazy.
 
 
00:16:22
 
Stephen Connell: sure.
Alex: They still do make it. All right. And then to the next is track systems. Yeah, that was all good. That was fine. I'm going to do some There is some updating. I was like, "Wow, these pictures are old. like that's a motor that doesn't actually exist anymore, but nobody knows that. They don't care. And someday,
Stephen Connell: which on the track systems.
Alex: you know,
Stephen Connell: Let's
Alex: yeah, like someday I'll probably update those,
Stephen Connell: see.
Alex: but to get this thing up and running, that's irrelevant. Um,
Stephen Connell: Yeah, we pulled these from your your old site, but we can certainly update them now.
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: Um, do you have any information on the bridge systems?
Alex: I do could get some get that over to you. Just make a note of that
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: bridge.
Stephen Connell: And then do you want us to pull pictures from from the company? Like are we allowed to just take their
Alex: Yes. Yeah. Well,
Stephen Connell: photos?
Alex: also they provide it um to us.
 
 
00:17:58
 
Alex: So, we do have some images. Did I forward this to you?
Stephen Connell: Mhm. Yeah. Go ahead.
Alex: Okay.
Stephen Connell: I'll search what what you've already fored us,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: but let's let's go keep keep adding them to that Google Drive.
Alex: Okay. Because they generally don't care either, but some manufacturers are going to care, so therefore we should keep it consistent.
Stephen Connell: Right. Yeah, that's that's a good point. So, let's let's focus on because you can get Yeah, you can get nailed for stealing photos.
Alex: Mhm. There might be something weird like because they are a global company and some of these are some of these
Stephen Connell: So, yeah.
Alex: companies are US companies, some of these are like local companies and you know if we keep it consistent then we will get out of hot you know
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Given given that they're product photos,
Alex: get in hot water.
Stephen Connell: I wouldn't expect there to be a problem. But there,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: you know, there are um you can really get nailed legally for using photos that you don't have permission
 
 
00:18:51
 
Alex: Yeah,
Stephen Connell: to use. So
Alex: I got enough problems.
Stephen Connell: yeah,
Alex: And and then under uh floor lifts, same the same category, patient transfer systems, floor lifts. Um they don't make the maxi sky Um, sorry I'm flipping back. Maxi light floor lift. They don't make that anymore. They also don't make the Sarah light standing lift.
Stephen Connell: Okay. So, hold on. There a light standing left.
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: and I'm just going to have to get you some updates on this because we also have to add some lifts here
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: like the Sarah 3000 as standing lift is now a ser flex lift and it's a completely different one. Uh maybe the best thing to do is to figure out how to get some info to you on that just because I'm realizing there's a couple things that really do need to be added here.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: um which basically come off of this product resource guide that's on our that's basically where these are coming
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: from
 
 
00:20:55
 
Stephen Connell: Let me pull that up. The
Alex: correct. Yeah, the RJO product resource guide.
Stephen Connell: parjo.
Alex: So this is the current um you know our our our Sarah standing lifts that are there.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: There's three that are there. We have our slings and then we have our floor lifts that are the there you know there's the five that are there. Then we have our slings which are kind of then again going down to our which um the easy track systems the portable ceiling lifts. These pictures are more updated than what we currently have on the site,
Stephen Connell: Yeah. So,
Alex: too.
Stephen Connell: we'll use we can we can get photos from here. Click for brochure.
Alex: Okay.
Stephen Connell: It there's a link to the brochure for each product as well.
Alex: So, Mhm. Yeah. It's a pretty cool little thing. One thing,
Stephen Connell: And
Alex: this encompassed most everything we do with the exception of the actual ceiling lifts, the installation ones. Um, and they don't make the we don't have a product because it's all custom.
 
 
00:21:59
 
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: They were trying to work on something like that. They just haven't come up with it.
Stephen Connell: Gotcha.
Alex: Falling down on this. One of the things that So, we do these um it's called seating matters. The specialized recliners that are down on this page. We don't have that anywhere on our website. Um basically, they're a complex customizable recliner out of Europe. So, that was one thing I was like, "Wow, we don't have even wonder why we don't get a lot of things. We don't even have it on our website." Um, same thing going down to the hygiene products like these particular uh really complex, especially um some of these shower chairs.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: Um let's see. I don't think we even have those.
Stephen Connell: You want to just make sure everything that's on here is on your site.
Alex: I do. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Okay. Okay. So,
Alex: including
Stephen Connell: we'll go through and make sure everything that's in this resource guide is on your site.
Alex: the freedom tubs that are out there that back are all the way down at the bottom.
 
 
00:23:12
 
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: Um cuz it's a unique product. Um I don't really like walk-in tubs at all. Um but these particular tubs are not walk-in tubs. You can see the whole side goes and you can do a patient transfer system or you know use a like a sit to stand or something to transfer a patient which is unique to us. again. Um, and then the same thing. Yeah, mattresses.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I was like, "Oh, we don't have any mattresses or beds that we do." And then I found one doing inventory. I'm like, "Here's a a rotational mattress in storage that's sitting here that uh I need to at least give away or something. They're expensive. You know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: they take a patient and they consistently rotate them for bed source."
Stephen Connell: Oh, yeah.
Alex: Cool.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: And there are many thousands of dollars and I'm like, here's one in a box.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: So again, that just basically everything that's on here. That would be great.
Stephen Connell: You got it. You get that going.
 
 
00:24:14
 
Alex: Um, our walk-in tubs are completely outdated. They don't even make these anymore. Um, uh, how do I even deal with that? Um, we just don't even do a lot of them. But I think um
Stephen Connell: I think if you could give me like keep running through which ones you want to remove that'd be really helpful. Um so we'll we'll add based on that
Alex: Okay. Um so let's go from
Stephen Connell: that document. Um and then and then let's just run through them.
Alex: Okay.
Stephen Connell: If do you want to run through them on the call right now and just go through all the products and I'll I'll make a note.
Alex: Sure. Might as well, right?
Stephen Connell: Yeah. So, for walk-in tubs,
Alex: They basically don't make any of these.
Stephen Connell: which of these do you want to remove?
Alex: They don't make any of them.
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: Um, they make a plethora of them though. So,
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: um, and I don't think that we want to include all these because God, they just make a shitload of these right now.
 
 
00:25:28
 
Alex: I wonder if there's a
Stephen Connell: So,
Alex: way.
Stephen Connell: it would be better to have like a landing page that says they make a bunch of of different tubs and contact us and we can help
Alex: Yeah, I think that would be appropriate cuz wait a second.
Stephen Connell: you.
Alex: If I can send you I mean I could send you a link just so you have an idea. Let me do this. Let's call it manufacturers. Um, and part of the reason for this is that um, Best Bath specifically is a company that's a relatively easy to get a distri um, to become a dealer for. And so it's not like a very unique thing.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: where Argo and that product resource like we have all of uh Northern Central California. There's like two of us in the in the entirety of the state. And so,
Stephen Connell: Gotcha.
Alex: and then we're also a a platinum dealer with them. So, we um and have been for many many many years. And so, that's unique to us. Like, if you need a product from RGO, you have to get it from us.
 
 
00:26:47
 
Alex: versus best bath you could probably call anybody which is why I'm like
Stephen Connell: Right. That makes sense.
Alex: we don't have to put a lot of energy into that. Um and let's see
Stephen Connell: Yes.
Alex: the custom wall panels is fine which is the next that's just a we can put tile inserts with them. Um, we used to do a lot of best bath systems and the over the last few years their pricing has increased. I mean, one of these fiberglass uh, you know,
Stephen Connell: Oh, yeah. I understand
Alex: just standard. Yeah, it's just expensive. So,
Stephen Connell: that.
Alex: we rarely do them anymore. Um, portable hygiene options, the shower bay, we still do. Shower trolley, we still do.
Stephen Connell: What did you want to do with the last one with the custom wall custom shower wall
Alex: Yeah,
Stephen Connell: panels?
Alex: that's fine cuz it's just under there.
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: I'm trying to think of like cuz now we have the best we have the home modifications which is going to incorporate more of like what we do with bathrooms and then eventually'll put some kitchens and just I'm going to start trying to accumulate a little bit more things.
 
 
00:27:55
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I even um I was like, "Oh, I was thinking about a couple doors that we just did or um uh doorways, you know, that we could even put on there too to widen up a hallway,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: you know, just weird stuff like that. I was thinking uh which I can send you." Um so we
Stephen Connell: Yeah, we mentioned that last time.
Alex: we don't have necessarily uh Good. I'm glad you're keeping track of our story so you're like,
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: "Don't repeat yourself."
Stephen Connell: I Yeah, I've got notes from last time and this call is being transcribed by AI,
Alex: Uh,
Stephen Connell: so I'll use that to make sure I don't miss anything.
Alex: how do you do
Stephen Connell: Honestly,
Alex: that?
Stephen Connell: it just said at the beginning, do you want AI to transcribe this call on? So, I was like, yeah, let's try that this time.
Alex: Oh, cool. Because I clicked on it, too. I was like, "Yeah, I'm fine with that." It's like when I go to the doctors now and they're like,
 
 
00:28:47
 
Alex: "Do you have a problem?" I'm like, "No, not at all." Sounds
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah. At first,
Alex: great.
Stephen Connell: Google was trying to sell a lot of their AI stuff and I just was like, "No, I don't want to pay for that." Like, and then they started telling me like, "Okay, it's you have it now. Like, try it. Just try it, please." And I was like, "All right, fine. We'll give it a shot.
Alex: I love that. I was uh going through um subscriptions just having one of those subscription fatigue thing and um and then it was kind of funny like whatever that service you can sign up for that
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: will go find all the subscriptions that you have but then they're also subscription service and I'm like this
Stephen Connell: Oh, yeah.
Alex: is funny.
Stephen Connell: That is ironic.
Alex: I would have I was like I wanted to be in that meeting then I'm like hey why don't we develop something that finds all
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: your subscriptions but then we're also a subscription service for this
 
 
00:29:39
 
Stephen Connell: like it'll be worth it because we're saving you money.
Alex: yeah right
Stephen Connell: That seems like a one-time thing. I mean,
Alex: yeah not an ongoing like I need this service once and I'm like I don't have that many
Stephen Connell: yeah.
Alex: um all right so I'm under the next thing that the um accessory portion of it
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: premium I mean we have. It's fine. I don't even know what these grab bars are, frankly. Um, but it just shows that we do seats and I think that's fine.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I don't want to I don't want to spend a huge amount of time on that. It's just it's just part of it.
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: I could care less if somebody calls us for a grab bar. Um, it's it's a nice leadin for products.
Stephen Connell: Gotcha.
Alex: It's good to have because a lot of times we do grab bars and they lead to other things.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: But and then we have the C chrome products which is the next I mean there's really nothing there.
 
 
00:30:36
 
Alex: I mean we're a S chrome dealer but we're a dealer for so many other products too. Like this page is kind of I don't even know.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: This is really irrelevant because Cchrome is a specific manufacturer and we're a dealer for many of these manufacturers. So, I'm not going to list out each manufacturer and accessories on grab bars. That's too much. That's overload. So,
Stephen Connell: right?
Alex: let's just delete C chrome products because we already have accessories.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Okay.
Alex: And maybe maybe we label that as instead of accessories, bath accessories, cuz it does say bath accessories. I don't even know. Like if you're under best bath systems and it says walk-in tubs, custom shower, wall burners,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: portable hygiene options, and accessories. Maybe it's bath accessories instead of that cuz I would be like I don't know what accessories are.
Stephen Connell: So,
Alex: Um
Stephen Connell: we've got we if this section is like best bath systems,
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: do you want to do you want to rename that to just like bath systems or
 
 
00:31:50
 
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: like
Alex: That's exactly what I was just thinking about. Um because we the portable hygiene options has
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: zero to do with best bath.
Stephen Connell: Make sure he's in bathroom.
Alex: They're completely different.
Stephen Connell: Bathroom systems or bath
Alex: What do we call this?
Stephen Connell: systems.
Alex: That's a great question. Let me go to their website because I'm like, what do you call yourself? Um, multi-piece shower systems.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Um, God, I don't really know what to do. Showers, showers and tubs. Maybe maybe we just leave it because it's like there it says shower.
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: Then we have tubs and shower pans, shop balls, you know.
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: Um
Stephen Connell: I think that sounds great. Showers and tubs and then you can have accessories and that has handles and
Alex: yeah, that makes more sense. Mhm.
Stephen Connell: whatever.
Alex: And then we just completely eliminate the Chrome product page. Um,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: we have the walk-in tubs that essentially could lead right to the best bath something, you know, we're talking about best bath or something.
 
 
00:33:07
 
Alex: Um, but we can also put those RGO um tubs in there. I guess that would be a landing page for them.
Stephen Connell: Yeah, let's just keep the walk-in tubs generic and have it include best bath and and RGO
Alex: Ar just wondering what we call those.
Stephen Connell: tubs.
Alex: Hold on. It's It's not a walk-in tub. I was trying to think of a better word for it, but um it might just have to be walking to. Just wanted to see what they actually call that. Oh, great. I'm in a different country. Give me a country that is not Swedish. It's funny that I go to this all the time and uh yet they send me to Sweden all the time and
Stephen Connell: That is
Alex: they're
Stephen Connell: funny.
Alex: services and solutions products. So the other thing I guess we could follow the RGO thing like they has ceiling lift solutions, floor lifts, lateral transfers, slings,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: standing raising edge. So they're just calling it hygiene which then they have bath lifters,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: bath systems.
 
 
00:34:31
 
Stephen Connell: So, they use the word hygiene for bathroom,
Alex: Um yeah,
Stephen Connell: which makes sense because it's not just
Alex: and then underneath
Stephen Connell: bath.
Alex: Mhm. Yeah. And then underneath it, they have lifts, you know, the bath actual systems for the tubs, uh the shower systems, which have um you know, the chairs, including the shower trolley.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Um yeah, maybe we just copy what the manufacturer is putting together.
Stephen Connell: Yeah, that sounds good.
Alex: And then for the walk-in tubs, you know, under under that where we have um the hygiene or whatever, it can somewhere in that landing page could just be a verbiage of walk-in tubs or something like that. So if there's a keyword or something where yeah,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: let's just copy what the manufacturers are doing. There's no reason to make it more difficult, right?
Stephen Connell: Well, I do think that we want to kind of target certain keywords.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: But we both want to target industry specific keywords like hygiene, but also keywords that people are going to actually use,
Alex: Yeah.
 
 
00:35:45
 
Stephen Connell: which are like
Alex: Like walking tub. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: bathroom.
Alex: Because if somebody's actually looking for a walk-in tub, they're going to the industry is going to use walk-in tub. So, for instance,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: like um we did not get this deal, but um we're called in to do some other things, but they got a walk-in tub from some uh you know, national company. I was like, "Oh,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: great. We do those, too." And they're like, "Oh, we didn't know that." I'm like, "Perfect.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Spent $17,000 not with us."
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah. Right. So, and they're probably going to search for bathtub,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: I think.
Alex: And I would say they would say bathtub, but I think they would say walk-in tub because just that's what we're like, you know,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: when you like I like when if I'm explaining, you know, having an elevator conversation about what I do and they're like, "Oh, walk-in tubs and there's things that go upstairs, right?" I'm like,
 
 
00:36:44
 
Alex: "Yeah,
Stephen Connell: Yep. Yep.
Alex: kind of." It's a thing I've been trying to do
Stephen Connell: Exactly.
Alex: is like pay more attention to what people like, you know, those very short conversations.
Stephen Connell: That's a great idea.
Alex: Um,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: and which I'll continue to do and just try to pry into that and go where, you know, what is, you know, the the person at a hotel bar,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: you know, what are they repeating back to me or asking about? And then trying to keep a, you know, a list of that type of stuff.
Stephen Connell: Yep. That's a great idea.
Alex: because obviously we can make changes in the future, but let's going to get this thing going on. All right, so I think we're kind of through that page. And then we're lifts and ramps and lifts and ramps. So here's another um Oops. H. So, one of the things I noticed like we do have this transition mats which let me just
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: call see what safe path out of Chico what do they call I was just looking
 
 
00:38:00
 
Stephen Connell: Nice.
Alex: at safe path and seeing what I'm like what do they actually call these know. Um, it's like every manufacturer has gone to these keywords, too, cuz people have like don't understand what that is. All right.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: So, they've actually gone to just calling it a wheelchair ramp.
Stephen Connell: Yeah, that makes
Alex: Yeah. So,
Stephen Connell: sense.
Alex: now we've gone from um threshold ramps, which was the original, to transition to now we're back to just wheelchair ramps, which does make a lot more sense.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: We shut this door.
Stephen Connell: So, let's Yeah.
Alex: Let's just combine that,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: right?
Stephen Connell: Let's create a wheelchair ramps page.
Alex: Yeah. And so one of the things we have here is a specific manufacturer that's called Prairie View Industries which quite frankly we don't use very often. Um the actual company which we use most often is Easy Access. And easy access also has one of the key things that I I saw here that we don't have is their commercial line of ramps. So easy access makes a commercial compliant ramp and that's a category that I want to increase this year and we don't have anything about this.
 
 
00:39:44
 
Alex: So commercial um ADA ramps and that's a whole different um area in which we could increase and that's called their it's called their pathway HD uh code compliant modular
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: ramp and they make those in that uh you know all those portable buildings, construction sites, every you know all the things that basically have no interest of doing concrete or anything like that But I have all the interest in the world of doing these and we don't have that anywhere on
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: here. And so, um, folding ramps, so it it shouldn't be I got too many tabs open. Hold on. I love websites, too. They're like, "How can we help you?" I'm like, "Nothing. Hold on a second. Let me close you." Um, okay. So, we now have wheelchair ramps. And that'll just transition to basically a landing page that says wheelchair ramps. And then those transition mats can be underneath there.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: You know, portable folding ramps. They can just be um let's see what they call them now. They're calling them portable ramps.
 
 
00:41:08
 
Alex: So easy access has this is modular wheelchair ramps, portable ramps, threshold ramps, and deck railing. Deck railing is a new product they kind of came out with. Um, and then the HD compliant, so portable, modular, solid, threshold, one of a kind,
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: and you know, we have these pictures, these modular ramp pictures, but those are our pictures where we have easy accesses manufactured ones that look better than that.
Stephen Connell: I was wondering which pictures were yours and which ones are
Alex: all of those. So, the portable ramp ones, those are manufacturer pictures.
Stephen Connell: Gotcha.
Alex: The modular ramp page, um those are all um ours. And that does link to a that brochure which we could also link Easy Access's
Stephen Connell: Where is the mod? Wait,
Alex: brochure to uh the test
Stephen Connell: I'm not seeing that page on your current website or on the test site.
Alex: site. Just scroll down. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Oh,
Alex: So I'm under prayer review industry ramps and then if you
Stephen Connell: okay. Got
Alex: scroll down to the then it says modular then it says solid thresholds and
 
 
00:42:31
 
Stephen Connell: it.
Alex: then one of a kind.
Stephen Connell: Should we combine this page with the transition maps page?
Alex: Yeah. Yes.
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: Yeah. Let's make it all just wheelchair ramps because nobody's going to be searching for Prairie View Industries.
Stephen Connell: Yep. No.
Alex: They're going to they're going to No wonder why people don't call us,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: right? It shouldn't be anything specific to, you know, it just should say wheelchair ramps and then
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Okay. So, we'll create a nice wheelchair ramps landing page that combines these. What about that middle one? What's that?
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: What was that one? Um, porch lifts. You want porch list on its
Alex: I do. And I want to call it Let's go.
Stephen Connell: own?
Alex: Let's see. I think Bruno. And it's going to be vertical platform lifts really. Or let's just call it platform lifts because that's what Bruno is calling it right now.
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: And then we're going to have underneath that.
 
 
00:43:40
 
Stephen Connell: Platform lifts.
Alex: Yep. And call it platform lifts. And then we have just Mac lifts, but we don't have anything about we have again a very specific manufacturer out of Long Beach, but we don't have anything about the manufacturer that we actually use all the time,
Stephen Connell: which
Alex: which is Bruno. Bruno Independent Living Aids and LiftUp is the new company
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: that is called the Flex Step and uh trying to say this so we have it in a uh the translate. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: So lift lift up flex step is one of the things in which we don't have um on there. Um, and technically we even are a Butler incline lift dealer too, which is basically a platform that's on a stairlift, you know. Um, we don't have any information on that.
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: So, that would be underneath those. And then um the other thing we don't have is what is called now Bruno home elevator um which is almost like its own category which is the ones that um I'm just on the manufact site and
 
 
00:44:50
 
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: there's their categories are stairlifts, scooter lifts, platform lifts, home elevators and so maybe the home elevator is a different length because these are ones that goes through the ceiling like through the floor.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: So they are different from a platform lift which I noticed we didn't have anything on our site about
Stephen Connell: So maybe we keep that as uh as do do you
Alex: that.
Stephen Connell: want to have elevators and like you you mentioned platform lift,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: but do we want to keep it do you want porch lifts,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: platform lifts, elevators or just kind of the lifts?
Alex: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Maybe we uh do that because that would be easy, right? If we just call it lifts, like wheelchair lifts.
Stephen Connell: Yeah, wheelchair lifts. That's
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: great.
Alex: And then we can put everything underneath there.
Stephen Connell: Now, would these lifts only be used for wheelchairs or would people walk onto them and then
Alex: Um, most of them are used for wheelchair lifts, but there are certain, excuse me, people that do use those just specifically because, you know, they have difficulty getting up.
 
 
00:46:15
 
Alex: I mean, so yes, there is um, but I think people would search more for I would say.
Stephen Connell: wheelchair
Alex: So, I'm trying to think of that like if um,
Stephen Connell: or elevator.
Alex: yeah,
Stephen Connell: Elevator seems like a bigger deal.
Alex: because a lot of time It does. I'm just going to do wheelchair lifts because I bet you when um you say wheelchair lifts, a lot of things are going to come back as a vehicle. All right. So, I just put in Google and actually it came up with all those
Stephen Connell: All
Alex: platform lifts.
Stephen Connell: right.
Alex: So, it must have some sort of thing that's in my I've probably searched for this before, but um I mean it came back with I guess with all kinds of stuff. What happens if I say poor charter? same kind of thing and then
Stephen Connell: And when I searched for wheelchair lifts,
Alex: pl
Stephen Connell: like the first one of the first pages was vertical platform lifts.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: And so I think wheelchair lifts is not a bad name.
 
 
00:47:37
 
Alex: Perfect. And again,
Stephen Connell: like the pictures match what what you're talking
Alex: it's it's also better. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: about.
Alex: And again, you're coming from a different, you know, side of things. So, if it sounds good to you, we're going with
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: you.
Stephen Connell: I think I think wheelchair lifts either just lifts or wheelchair lifts.
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: But since we're talking about doing wheelchair mats or I mean wheelchair ramps for the
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: mats,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: I think that makes sense.
Alex: And again, we we'll just change the verbiage as we want to, you know, if it something changes.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: Like I I do kind of pay attention to the manufacturers and they're constantly like changing it from, you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: wheelchair lifts to vertical platform lifts to platform lifts to, you know, anything that they can get obviously, which makes sense and obviously they have a big budget, so somebody's doing a lot of research on that. Um.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Uh. Okay. So, I think that's we just got to add some add some other things underneath there on the those other manufacturers.
 
 
00:48:51
 
Alex: The Bruno lifts and the lift up and the incline lift.
Stephen Connell: Sounds good.
Alex: and following in suit. Then we go down to stairway lifts, which Bruno is the Bruno is the only stair stair lift that we put in
Stephen Connell: Yes.
Alex: and now they're calling them stairlifts for their site.
Stephen Connell: Okay. Yeah,
Alex: So,
Stephen Connell: I'll change that.
Alex: let's see what's underneath here. The alone. They still make delete. They still make elite. This is Yeah, this is fine.
Stephen Connell: Are these your photos on on this page?
Alex: No, they're the manufacturer photos.
Stephen Connell: Okay, that's what I
Alex: They have updated ones,
Stephen Connell: thought.
Alex: but they do have those, but I don't know if it makes that much of a difference.
Stephen Connell: Okay, take a look.
Alex: Delete align curves. Yeah, that's pretty. I'm just going to do this incline.
Stephen Connell: It's pretty crazy. Stair lift in the backyard
Alex: Yeah, right.
Stephen Connell: there.
Alex: I got a couple of those ones weird like especially up in um Amador or Alador whatever coming out of the lake.
 
 
00:50:48
 
Stephen Connell: Mhm. Getting down to your boat.
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: Yeah, that's what I was thinking when I saw this picture. Like you turn around, there's got to be like a boat or
Alex: Yeah,
Stephen Connell: something.
Alex: which is another area of like these um incline platform lifts.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: So the incline platform lifts,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: you know, yes, they could be used for wheelchairs and stuff, but then you could also use those as people movers and then also when you have, you know,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: somebody that wants to transport things just up a hill. Um,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: I mean there's uh I was just thinking, you know, even in Tahoe, you know, get into Incline Village or some of those places where people have to transport things, you know, from a parking space all the way up.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: Um, that also works well.
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: And they're relatively inexpensive um, in comparison to,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: you know, some of the other solutions that they put in because these are manufactured. You don't have to do anything custom.
 
 
00:51:45
 
Stephen Connell: Right. Right. That makes sense.
Alex: And that's where the incline platform left. I was like, well, we don't even have those on our website.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Um
Stephen Connell: Yeah. So, I think it does make sense to I think it makes sense to use the word wheelchair, but it also makes sense to be more generic with it. So, if we can figure out how to do both,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: I think that would be good.
Alex: Yeah. Because as I guess if like if we're going through the product thing, patient transfer solutions, um we've changed some of these things. I guess you're right. Like it doesn't need when if people are landing on our site, we probably don't have to underneath there say wheelchair ramps. We could just say ramps because the landing page will have wheelchair ramps somewhere in
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yep. Right.
Alex: it.
Stephen Connell: And then we'll use the word wheelchair. Yep.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: So,
Alex: And then under like Yeah.
Stephen Connell: let's do the same thing.
 
 
00:52:41
 
Alex: Same thing. Lifts.
Stephen Connell: Lifts, ramps.
Alex: Um,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: now maybe stairlifts does have to be because that is a different
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: category.
Stephen Connell: One that Yeah, I think stairlift is a great Yeah, I think that's
Alex: So maybe if it was ramps.
Stephen Connell: great.
Alex: God, I still I I always want to say vertical platform lifts because that's what always sticks in my head. But maybe just lifts and then stair lifts because they don't
Stephen Connell: I do like vertical platform lifts because that's like really clear.
Alex: Okay.
Stephen Connell: And then that's also very different from from like a elevator.
Alex: Yeah. And then the next thing we had on here too is the automatic door operators or openers. Um, we still use these two that are underneath there, but then there's um the more ones that we always use is Open Sesame, which is out of the Bay Area, which we don't have on here, and Autoslide,
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: which Autoslide is makes the door opener kind of unique that um is for sliders, sliding doors. So,
 
 
00:53:55
 
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex: um I noticed we don't have any of that. And open sesame has like a plethora of all different ways. It's not relevant, but we can uh have doors activated by sip and puffs or proximity things. And you know, there's all different types that we can do and apps on a phone.
Stephen Connell: H
Alex: And you know, um we don't need to put all that stuff on there,
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: but uh that particular company that is on here, we really don't use that very much because their products are very limited. Um,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: so I just I got to let's see what Open Sesame says. I think they're called door operators now. I could type this morning. They're still called door opener. Open sesame door opener. So, what do we have here? It doesn't have to say necessarily automatic door opener. It's just door openers. automatic. I don't know.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I don't know if that gives anything detail.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I mean, they're door openers and we do those commercially and we do those um
 
 
00:55:39
 
Stephen Connell: It's like automatic's kind of given at this point
Alex: Right. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: probably.
Alex: Yeah. And I do want to somehow highlight that we do those residential and commercially. Um the commercial market of that. Um I've noticed we haven't done one of those in a while and that's we should be doing those more often because those are actually pretty good easy jobs for us. Commercial market for ramps. commercial market for door openers are two areas that we're just missing. And yet, you know, every door basically commercially has to have a door operator.
Stephen Connell: What does that mean?
Alex: Means that like if you go to every restaurant, you know, or commercial building,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: they're going to generally have an automatic door operator somewhere for accessibility almost in every like it
Stephen Connell: Like Yeah. Okay. By operator, you mean the ability for it to open automatically?
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: they they added one at Starbucks that we go to and it is so hard to open that
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: door.
 
 
00:56:58
 
Alex: Ridiculous,
Stephen Connell: Like for whatever reason, I always they have a double door and I always would use the one on the right.
Alex: right?
Stephen Connell: Like it just the way that the parking lot goes the one to use and they added the door opener
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: to the one on the right and now it's like significantly harder to push that door open. So I I had to like retrain myself to use the other
Alex: So, okay. So, there's a great thing.
Stephen Connell: door.
Alex: So, there so open sesame door operator when you use it manually, the clutch disengages. So, there's no resistance.
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: It operates as a as a uh without even um any sort of
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: force. But there's plenty of door openers out there or operators, whatever they call these things, that um are hard to deal with. For instance,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: the commercial ones that we currently have on our website, the Power Access ones suck. That's why I don't use them because you're fighting a door operator all the time.
 
 
00:57:52
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah, we should put that on
Alex: And yeah. Yeah.
Stephen Connell: there.
Alex: Like and I excuse me like I get irritated too the same way. Like if I go into a commercial thing and they have a door operator that I'm fighting, I'm like there's a better option here. Who put this stupid product in here?
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And um yeah, it's just I don't know. I'm always annoyed with it because like there's a better way, but somebody didn't know this and now they're in compliance, but they have a crappy solution to
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: this.
Stephen Connell: Exactly. Yeah. They like remodeled the whole Starbucks and then added this automatic door operator and it's just like
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: so I I had already had my routine of like that's the door I use,
Alex: Yep.
Stephen Connell: you know, and then I'd slam into it every day like f*** dang it, you know?
Alex: I love that you have like the it's you're I have this weird thing too. I'm glad I'm not alone. Like I have a routine the way I do things and I'm probably like OCD or some I have probably some
 
 
00:58:48
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: some something that I should be diagnosed with.
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah.
Alex: And so my wife would be like just use the other door.
Stephen Connell: Exactly.
Alex: I'm like you I don't understand like that's where I I I don't there's other things I'm thinking of.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I'm not thinking about what door it is that I use.
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: this is the door that I use. And she's like,
Stephen Connell: Yep.
Alex: I don't know why this is a big deal.
Stephen Connell: Exactly.
Alex: And I'm like,
Stephen Connell: Like Yep. Dude, I can even justify it.
Alex: I
Stephen Connell: Like I would take it takes two steps extra to use the other door. Like like when you open the door then I have to walk around the door to go the direction I want.
Alex: Oh, yeah.
Stephen Connell: Like I open the door that requires a few steps.
Alex: Mhm. Yes,
Stephen Connell: And so now I have to walk around the door every day or I have
Alex: I do, too.
 
 
00:59:26
 
Alex: Yeah. Uhhuh.
Stephen Connell: to push harder which is a silly first world problem.
Alex: It is definitely. I always love when I do this kind of stuff and I'm like am I autistic?
Stephen Connell: Right.
Alex: Like something's going but
Stephen Connell: That's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Just a little bit.
Alex: they have like under Yeah.
Stephen Connell: There's a spectrum.
Alex: I'm like I'm like just enough,
Stephen Connell: We're we're we're on the edge.
Alex: right?
Stephen Connell: Maybe not not actually autistic,
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: but presenting a
Alex: I don't want somebody to actually My uh my sister's a behavioral analyst
Stephen Connell: little.
Alex: like in uh works in the school systems and stuff and and uh I'm like don't ever do an evaluation on
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: me. Like I don't want to I just don't want to know. I've gotten this far.
Stephen Connell: like I don't want to know.
Alex: It's good. Uh Open Sesame like uh especially applications like some of these door operators that
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: we have like French doors, storm screen doors, uh elevators, you know, like an actual door in the elevators, the actual lifts like those vertical platform lifts like they have gates you could put operators on
 
 
01:00:24
 
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: those actual gates at homes. Um, and then they have even hidden applications like they're using an example of a uh library with a hidden door. So, there's just all kinds of crazy stuff we can do with these.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: And um the auto slide too again kind of unique be like we were in a situation where were a bid walk through and they're like uh with the auto um autoslide and like they well they don't make a door opener for a sliding door. I'm like, "Yes, they do." Like, "No, they don't." And I'm like, "And it's a competitor." And I'm like, "Why are we why are we arguing about this?" I'm like, "I have a product that that does this." And it's also for pocket doors, barn doors, any sort of thing that slides. And uh, you know, it was just kind of one of those situations in which it was like, "Stop talking. It does exist.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Stop telling the person that they don't exist." Um,
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: so I mean they have even pet proximity things like one of the things I was looking like automatic pet access.
 
 
01:01:36
 
Alex: Um,
Stephen Connell: Nice.
Alex: I was talking to a friend recently about um setting up their home for their pets when they travel like when they leave.
Stephen Connell: Oh
Alex: And um they were talking like oh it would be cool to have a door this and that.
Stephen Connell: yeah,
Alex: I'm like we could totally do that. It's a proximity reader. So, you know, like the dog could walk past the proximity reader. It doesn't take very long in the door.
Stephen Connell: but the raccoon camp is using like near field
Alex: Mhm.
Stephen Connell: communication.
Alex: Yeah.
Stephen Connell: Yeah,
Alex: I mean,
Stephen Connell: that's awesome.
Alex: so, and you could also do it from your phone. I mean, like a garage. I mean, so there's just this other weird part of the industry that um
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: I was thinking about that general conversation. I'm like, wait a second. There's also like these like I have automatic door um operators on my garage, you know, and I open and close those,
Stephen Connell: Mhm.
Alex: you know, sometimes for people. And then uh then was talking about these pets and I'm like, hm, I mean, it's not a it's not necessarily a market really, but it is something that people should be aware of.
 
 
01:02:36
 
Stephen Connell: Yeah. Yeah, for
Alex: um and that they exist on all doors and that we could do these things with other
Stephen Connell: sure.
Alex: uh you know not ne necessarily people with disabilities. So that was one area I was like wait a second we're we have nothing on there.
Stephen Connell: Yeah.
Alex: Um all right then I think that was my list.
Stephen Connell: Okay. Did I lose you? You still there? Hey, there you are. Can you hear me? Are you there?
Alex Grzebski: Stephen.
Stephen Connell: Yep. Got you now.
Alex Grzebski: All right, cool. I think I just closed you somehow or something.
Stephen Connell: There you go.
Alex Grzebski: Sorry about that.
Stephen Connell: Yeah, you were like mid-sentence and then it just went
Alex Grzebski: I was trying to get on our drive and I think I something happened. Anyways,
Stephen Connell: gotcha.
Alex Grzebski: I just uploaded the new website doc and I just added some of these things, but I realized what I'm going to add some like links like those walk-in tubs and just I don't know
Stephen Connell: Okay.
Alex Grzebski: just the notes for us. But I think we that's pretty good start right this
Stephen Connell: Yeah, I think this is great. Yep.
Alex Grzebski: week.
Stephen Connell: I've got got quite a bit to do and and we'll have some significant progress for you for our call for next week.
Alex Grzebski: Sounds good, man. Well,
Stephen Connell: Perfect.
