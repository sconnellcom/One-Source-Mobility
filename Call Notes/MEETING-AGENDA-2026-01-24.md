## ❓ QUESTIONS TO ASK ALEX

### Priority Questions (Critical for Moving Forward)

**Q4:** You mentioned Bruno products should be added as a priority. Can you:
- Confirm the specific Bruno vertical platform lift models to feature?
- Provide the Google doc link with Bruno product details?
- Clarify positioning: Should Bruno be shown ABOVE Maxcliff?
- Do you want Bruno home elevators on a separate page or combined with platform lifts?

#### Product Updates - LiftUp Flex Step (Jan 15 Priority)  
**Q5:** For the LiftUp Flex Step stair-to-lift converter:
- Is the product information available in the Google doc you mentioned?

- Any specific features or benefits to highlight?

#### Product Updates - Door Operators (Jan 15 Priority)
**Q6:** For Open Sesame and Auto Slide door openers:

- Should these replace current door operator products or be positioned above them?
- Are there specific applications (residential vs. commercial) to emphasize?

- Keep them visible but just reorder the page?
- Add any disclaimers about availability?

#### Walk-in Tubs & Freedom Tubs
**Q8:** For the walk-in tubs update:
- Should the generic walk-in tubs page be very minimal (just "contact us for options")?

- A separate page?
